Your program is robust for sorting and classifying text files into categories based on labels. However, for the specific use case of processing PDF files scraped from the internet for a Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) pipeline, the following enhancements could make it more efficient and accurate for filtering high-quality, relevant data:

### Suggested Improvements

1. **PDF to Text Conversion**: Ensure consistent quality of text extraction from PDFs. Use a library like `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer.six`, or `pytesseract` (for OCR) to handle this conversion robustly. Discard PDFs with extremely low or no extracted content.

2. **Initial Pre-filtering**:
   - **Language Detection**: Use a library like `langdetect` or `fastText` to filter out PDFs that are not in the desired language(s).
   - **Content Length Check**: Filter out files with very short text, as these might lack meaningful content.

3. **Enhanced Metadata Analysis**:
   - Extract metadata from PDFs, such as author, title, and subject, to help with initial relevance filtering.
   - Use metadata alongside text content for classification.

4. **Improved Embedding and Classification**:
   - Use more advanced embedding models like `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` for embeddings to achieve better contextual understanding.
   - Incorporate topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation or BERTopic) for clustering documents by relevance before classification.

5. **Quality Scoring**:
   - Compute a quality or relevance score for each document based on factors like cosine similarity, text coherence, and word overlap with your desired categories.
   - Set a threshold score to filter documents for inclusion in the vector database.

6. **Noise Reduction**:
   - Deduplicate content to handle potential scraper redundancies.
   - Normalize text (e.g., lowercasing, removing HTML artifacts, or other noise).

7. **Scalability**:
   - Use distributed processing tools like Apache Spark or Dask for handling a large number of files.
   - Implement batched processing for efficiency, especially when using large transformer models.

8. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - Periodically evaluate classification results and refine your labels or embeddings based on feedback.

### Modifications to Your Program
Add preprocessing steps for PDFs:
```python
from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    try:
        text = extract_text(pdf_path).strip()
        return text if len(text) > 50 else None  # Filter out very short text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error extracting text from PDF '{pdf_path}': {e}")
        return None
```

Incorporate language detection:
```python
from langdetect import detect

def is_language_acceptable(text, allowed_languages=("en")):
    try:
        lang = detect(text)
        return lang in allowed_languages
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error detecting language: {e}")
        return False
```

Update file processing loop:
```python
# Process each PDF file
for file_name in os.listdir(target_dir):
    file_path = os.path.join(target_dir, file_name)

    if os.path.isfile(file_path) and file_name.endswith(".pdf") and file_name not in processed_files:
        pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf(file_path)
        if not pdf_text or not is_language_acceptable(pdf_text):
            print(f"Skipping low-quality or non-relevant PDF: {file_name}")
            continue

        # Use pdf_text for classification
        ...
```

### Output
- **Classifications** stored in CSV and JSON files as before.
- **Filtered and Cleaned PDFs** stored in a designated output directory for further processing.

By integrating these improvements, your pipeline will efficiently filter and classify a large, heterogeneous dataset of PDFs for building a highly relevant vector database for your RAG setup.
