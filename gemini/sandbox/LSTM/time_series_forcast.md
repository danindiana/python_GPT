To train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using TensorFlow for time-series forecasting on your GPU, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Ensure you have TensorFlow installed with GPU support. You can install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow
     ```
   - Verify that TensorFlow can see your GPU:
     ```python
     import tensorflow as tf
     print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
     ```

### 2. **Load and Preprocess the Data**
   - Load the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Preprocess the data to create sequences for the LSTM model.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   # Load the CSV data
   df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

   # Sort by timestampms to ensure the data is in chronological order
   df = df.sort_values(by='timestampms')

   # Extract the features and target variable
   features = df[['price', 'amount']].values
   target = df['price'].values

   # Normalize the features (optional but recommended)
   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
   scaler = MinMaxScaler()
   features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

   # Create sequences for the LSTM model
   def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
       X, y = [], []
       for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
           X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])
           y.append(data[i+seq_length])
       return np.array(X), np.array(y)

   seq_length = 5  # Example sequence length
   X, y = create_sequences(features, seq_length)
   ```

### 3. **Build the LSTM Model**
   - Define the LSTM model using TensorFlow's Keras API.

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

   model = Sequential()
   model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(seq_length, X.shape[2])))
   model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
   model.add(Dense(25))
   model.add(Dense(1))

   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
   ```

### 4. **Train the Model**
   - Train the model on the GPU. TensorFlow will automatically use the GPU if available.

   ```python
   model.fit(X, y, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
   ```

### 5. **Evaluate and Predict**
   - Evaluate the model on a test set (if available) or use it to make predictions.

   ```python
   # Assuming you have a test set X_test, y_test
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 6. **Save the Model**
   - Save the trained model for future use.

   ```python
   model.save('lstm_model.h5')
   ```

### 7. **Optional: Use TensorBoard for Monitoring**
   - You can use TensorBoard to monitor the training process.

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

   tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs', histogram_freq=1)
   model.fit(X, y, batch_size=32, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
   ```

### 8. **Optional: Use Mixed Precision for Faster Training**
   - If you want to speed up training, you can use mixed precision.

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras import mixed_precision
   mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')
   ```

### Summary
- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the data, create sequences for the LSTM.
- **Model Building**: Define the LSTM model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Training**: Train the model on the GPU.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model and make predictions.
- **Save**: Save the trained model for future use.

This setup should allow you to train an LSTM model for time-series forecasting on your GPU efficiently.
