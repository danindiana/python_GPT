To train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using TensorFlow for time-series forecasting on your GPU, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Ensure you have TensorFlow installed with GPU support. You can install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow
     ```
   - Verify that TensorFlow can see your GPU:
     ```python
     import tensorflow as tf
     print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
     ```

### 2. **Load and Preprocess the Data**
   - Load the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Preprocess the data to create sequences for the LSTM model.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   # Load the CSV data
   df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

   # Sort by timestampms to ensure the data is in chronological order
   df = df.sort_values(by='timestampms')

   # Extract the features and target variable
   features = df[['price', 'amount']].values
   target = df['price'].values

   # Normalize the features (optional but recommended)
   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
   scaler = MinMaxScaler()
   features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

   # Create sequences for the LSTM model
   def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
       X, y = [], []
       for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
           X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])
           y.append(data[i+seq_length])
       return np.array(X), np.array(y)

   seq_length = 5  # Example sequence length
   X, y = create_sequences(features, seq_length)
   ```

### 3. **Build the LSTM Model**
   - Define the LSTM model using TensorFlow's Keras API.

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

   model = Sequential()
   model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(seq_length, X.shape[2])))
   model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
   model.add(Dense(25))
   model.add(Dense(1))

   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
   ```

### 4. **Train the Model**
   - Train the model on the GPU. TensorFlow will automatically use the GPU if available.

   ```python
   model.fit(X, y, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
   ```

### 5. **Evaluate and Predict**
   - Evaluate the model on a test set (if available) or use it to make predictions.

   ```python
   # Assuming you have a test set X_test, y_test
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 6. **Save the Model**
   - Save the trained model for future use.

   ```python
   model.save('lstm_model.h5')
   ```

### 7. **Optional: Use TensorBoard for Monitoring**
   - You can use TensorBoard to monitor the training process.

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

   tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs', histogram_freq=1)
   model.fit(X, y, batch_size=32, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
   ```

### 8. **Optional: Use Mixed Precision for Faster Training**
   - If you want to speed up training, you can use mixed precision.

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras import mixed_precision
   mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')
   ```

### Summary
- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the data, create sequences for the LSTM.
- **Model Building**: Define the LSTM model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Training**: Train the model on the GPU.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model and make predictions.
- **Save**: Save the trained model for future use.

This setup should allow you to train an LSTM model for time-series forecasting on your GPU efficiently.

### Further Troubleshooting

The error messages you're seeing indicate that TensorFlow is having trouble loading the necessary GPU libraries. This can happen for several reasons, such as missing or incompatible CUDA or cuDNN libraries. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### 1. **Verify CUDA and cuDNN Installation**
   - Ensure that you have the correct versions of CUDA and cuDNN installed that are compatible with your TensorFlow version.
   - TensorFlow 2.x typically requires CUDA 11.x and cuDNN 8.x.

### 2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Make sure the environment variables `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PATH` are set correctly to point to the CUDA and cuDNN libraries.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```

### 3. **Reinstall TensorFlow with GPU Support**
   - If you haven't already, reinstall TensorFlow with GPU support:
     ```bash
     pip uninstall tensorflow
     pip install tensorflow-gpu
     ```

### 4. **Verify GPU Drivers**
   - Ensure that your GPU drivers are up to date. You can check this with `nvidia-smi`.

### 5. **Check TensorFlow Compatibility**
   - Ensure that the TensorFlow version you are using is compatible with your CUDA and cuDNN versions. You can check the compatibility matrix [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu).

### 6. **Run a Simple GPU Test**
   - Run a simple TensorFlow script to verify that TensorFlow can see and use the GPU.

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf

   # Check if TensorFlow can see the GPU
   print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

   # Run a simple computation on the GPU
   with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
       a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3], name='a')
       b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2], name='b')
       c = tf.matmul(a, b)

   print(c)
   ```

### 7. **Check for Missing Libraries**
   - The error message mentions missing libraries. Ensure that all required libraries are installed. You can install them using the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-<version>
     sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
     sudo apt-get install libcudnn8
     ```

### 8. **Rebuild TensorFlow from Source (Advanced)**
   - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can try rebuilding TensorFlow from source with the appropriate compiler flags. This is an advanced option and requires a good understanding of building software from source.

### Summary
- **Verify CUDA and cuDNN**: Ensure they are correctly installed and compatible with TensorFlow.
- **Environment Variables**: Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PATH` correctly.
- **Reinstall TensorFlow**: Ensure you have the GPU version installed.
- **GPU Drivers**: Ensure they are up to date.
- **Compatibility**: Check TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN compatibility.
- **Simple Test**: Run a simple TensorFlow script to verify GPU usage.
- **Missing Libraries**: Ensure all required libraries are installed.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and get TensorFlow to recognize and use your GPU.
