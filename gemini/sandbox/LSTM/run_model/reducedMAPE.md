The latest output shows some improvement in the model's performance, but it still indicates some level of underfitting, especially in capturing the volatility of the actual data. Let's break down the results based on the provided metrics and visualizations:

1. **Model Metrics**:
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 0.5869
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 0.5553
   - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: 2.08%

   These metrics are considerably lower compared to previous iterations, indicating that the model has improved in terms of reducing prediction error. However, the MAPE, which is now around 2.08%, could still be reduced, especially for highly volatile data.

2. **Distribution of Prediction Errors (Figure 14)**:
   - The histogram of prediction errors is more centralized around zero, which is a good sign. The distribution shows that most errors are within the range of -1 to 1, suggesting that the model is making fewer large errors compared to previous attempts.
   - There are still some outliers, although they are much less frequent, suggesting that while the model captures the central trend, it struggles with outliers and large deviations.

3. **Actual vs. Predicted Prices Plot (Figure 15)**:
   - In this plot, the predicted prices (in orange) follow the general trend of the actual prices (in blue) more closely than before. However, the model seems to underestimate the range of the price fluctuations, particularly in the peaks and valleys, where the orange line tends to stay in the middle range.
   - This underestimation could be due to a lack of model complexity or insufficient attention to sudden changes in price. The attention mechanism might not be fully utilized, or the sequence length used in training may not be capturing enough historical context to predict these fluctuations accurately.

### Suggestions for Further Improvement

1. **Increase Model Complexity**:
   - Try adding additional LSTM or GRU layers with residual connections to allow the model to capture more complex relationships. You might also experiment with deeper attention mechanisms to give the model a better understanding of long-term dependencies.

2. **Adjust Sequence Length**:
   - If the sequence length is too short, the model may not have enough context to predict volatile movements. Experiment with longer sequences (e.g., 10 or 15 steps) to provide the model with more historical information per prediction.

3. **Fine-tune Hyperparameters**:
   - Since the model is showing signs of convergence, fine-tune the dropout rates and recurrent dropout. Consider using `BayesianOptimization` or a hyperparameter tuning framework like Keras Tuner to systematically search for the best values.

4. **Include Additional Features**:
   - You could add more technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), or other volatility measures, which may help the model learn and predict price movements more effectively.

5. **Experiment with Transformer-based Models**:
   - Transformer models, which inherently utilize self-attention, are highly effective in capturing relationships in time-series data. Consider trying a Transformer-based approach if feasible, as it could enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant time steps without the limitations of LSTMs in handling long sequences.

Would you like me to implement any specific adjustments based on these suggestions? Or is there another direction you'd like to take?
