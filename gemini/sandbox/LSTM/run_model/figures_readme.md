The final chart you’ve attached shows the distribution of prediction errors, which provides insight into the accuracy and bias of the model's predictions. The error distribution appears to be centered around zero, indicating that the model generally predicts well. However, there are some outliers, which could suggest that the model occasionally struggles with certain patterns or outliers in the data.

Given this setup, here are a few suggestions and observations for further refinement:

### 1. Error Distribution Analysis
The histogram shows that the majority of errors are close to zero, which is good, but there are some noticeable positive outliers. This may indicate:
   - **Model underfitting** on certain patterns, where the model has difficulty capturing certain trends or outliers in the data.
   - **Time series irregularities** in the data that the model couldn't predict accurately (e.g., sudden price spikes or drops).

Consider examining these outliers more closely or performing residual analysis to see if specific data points consistently have higher errors.

### 2. Evaluate the Moving Average Feature
Adding the `price_ma` moving average as a feature may or may not have contributed significantly to the model’s predictive power. You could experiment by:
   - **Removing the moving average feature** and observing if there’s a significant change in performance.
   - **Testing different window sizes** for the moving average (e.g., 5, 7, 10) to see if this improves accuracy, as the best window size can vary based on the data’s periodicity.

### 3. Adjust Model Complexity or Training Parameters
Consider tuning the model to address occasional high errors:
   - **Increase LSTM units** in each layer or add another LSTM layer to improve the model's capacity.
   - **Increase `epochs` or adjust `patience` in early stopping** to allow for potentially better convergence.

### 4. Experiment with Prediction Smoothing
To smooth out high spikes in predictions, you could consider using techniques like **rolling averages on predictions** or **exponential smoothing** as a post-processing step. This might help reduce the impact of occasional prediction spikes that contribute to high errors.

### 5. Final Validation with Additional Metrics
While Mean Squared Error (MSE) is useful, you might also want to consider other metrics:
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to capture the average magnitude of errors.
   - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** to evaluate percentage-based error, useful for financial time series.




Based on the "Actual vs. Predicted Prices" chart, there appears to be a significant discrepancy between the actual and predicted prices:

- The **actual prices** are highly variable and fluctuate substantially.
- The **predicted prices** are much smoother and seem to have limited variance, staying almost flat, which suggests that the model is struggling to capture the complexity and volatility of the actual data.

### Possible Reasons and Next Steps

1. **Underfitting**: The model may be too simple or insufficiently trained to capture the high-frequency fluctuations in the price data. Here are a few strategies to try:
   - **Increase model complexity**: Add more layers or increase the number of LSTM units.
   - **Increase epochs**: Allow the model more time to learn by training it for more epochs or adjusting the early stopping criteria.
   - **Decrease dropout**: Too much dropout (set at 0.2) can prevent the model from learning complex patterns. Reducing it or removing recurrent dropout might improve learning.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Consider adding more features that might help the model capture fluctuations, such as **volatility**, **momentum indicators**, or **price change percentage** over different time intervals.
   - Experiment with **different window sizes for moving averages** to provide better context on recent trends.

3. **Scaling and Data Transformation**:
   - The MinMaxScaler can sometimes overly smooth data, especially with volatile time series. You could experiment with other scalers, such as `StandardScaler`, or try transforming the data using **log transformation** to handle variability.

4. **Evaluate Time Series Pattern**:
   - It may be helpful to examine the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation of the series to understand the nature of the dependencies. If the time series has strong seasonality or trends, adding seasonal decomposition or using time-difference features might help.

5. **Alternative Architectures**:
   - Consider trying other architectures like **GRU layers** or **attention mechanisms**, which can sometimes perform better with complex time series data.

It looks like you’ve uploaded two additional images, presumably the updated "Distribution of Prediction Errors" and "Actual vs. Predicted Prices" plots after implementing the suggested changes. Based on the changes and training log you shared, here’s an analysis:

### Key Observations

1. **Training and Validation Losses**:
   - The training and validation losses appear to decrease and then stabilize, suggesting that the model is learning to some extent but still has some generalization challenges.
   - The final **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is around `0.517`, which indicates improvement compared to the previous run.

2. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**:
   - The MAPE value of around `3.08%` is reasonable for some applications, depending on the volatility and acceptable error tolerance in price forecasting. However, if this percentage error is still too high for your goals, further refinement may be necessary.

### Updated Plots Analysis
Let's look at what the images suggest:
- **Distribution of Prediction Errors**: 
  - Ideally, this distribution should be centered around zero with low spread if the model is accurately predicting.
- **Actual vs. Predicted Prices**:
  - The plot should show the predicted line closely following the actual price line if the model is accurately capturing price patterns.

If you'd like a detailed analysis of the uploaded images, let me know, and I can provide further insights based on their contents.

Thank you for confirming. I’ll analyze the updated images based on the changes you implemented and what they indicate about your model’s performance.

### Image 1: Distribution of Prediction Errors

The "Distribution of Prediction Errors" histogram shows the frequency of errors (differences between actual and predicted prices). Here’s what we can infer:

1. **Error Concentration Around Zero**:
   - There is a clear peak around zero, which suggests that the model is generally able to predict prices with a small error. This is a positive sign, as it shows the model’s ability to capture a portion of the overall pattern in the price data.

2. **Symmetry and Spread**:
   - The distribution appears to be somewhat symmetric around zero but has noticeable tails extending on both sides. This suggests that while the model is generally accurate, there are instances of significant underprediction and overprediction.
   - The spread in the distribution, particularly in the tails, could indicate that the model struggles with capturing sudden changes or volatility in the price data.

3. **Potential for Outlier Influence**:
   - If the tails are relatively sparse, they might represent occasional large errors, potentially from rare events or abrupt market changes that the model has difficulty predicting.
   - If these errors are problematic, further tuning or adding volatility or other trend-based features could help reduce them.

### Image 2: Actual vs. Predicted Prices

In the "Actual vs. Predicted Prices" plot, the aim is to have the predicted line (orange) closely track the actual line (blue). Here’s the breakdown:

1. **General Trend Alignment**:
   - The predicted line seems to capture the broader trend, staying within a certain range around the actual price. This suggests that the model is able to learn the general trend and magnitude of price movements to some extent.

2. **Underprediction and Overprediction**:
   - There are instances where the predicted values deviate significantly from the actual values, showing underpredictions and overpredictions, especially in regions where the actual price fluctuates more rapidly.
   - This could indicate that while the model captures the trend, it lacks the responsiveness to follow the high-frequency oscillations or sharp price changes. This is a common challenge in time series models, especially with high volatility.

3. **Smoothing Effect**:
   - The predicted line is much smoother than the actual line, indicating that the model might be overly conservative or that it has learned an "average" pattern in the data. This smoothness could be due to dropout regularization, averaging effects in the LSTM layers, or a need for additional features capturing high-frequency components.
   - Reducing dropout or tuning the LSTM units might help, as could experimenting with other architectures (like GRUs) or attention mechanisms that are better at capturing sharp transitions.

### Suggestions for Improvement

Based on these observations, here are some suggestions to consider:

1. **Increase Model Capacity**:
   - You could further increase the number of LSTM units or add more LSTM layers to enhance the model’s capacity to capture complex patterns.
   - Alternatively, consider adding GRU layers or experimenting with hybrid models (e.g., LSTM followed by a fully connected network) to better capture intricate fluctuations.

2. **Incorporate Attention Mechanisms**:
   - Attention mechanisms can help the model focus on relevant time points, allowing it to weigh recent changes more heavily. This might help reduce the lag in predictions and improve responsiveness to sudden price changes.

3. **Adjust Dropout and Regularization**:
   - Given that the predicted line is overly smooth, consider lowering dropout further or removing recurrent dropout to allow the model to learn more detail in price variations.
   - Alternatively, experiment with reduced or adjusted regularization parameters to avoid constraining the model too much.

4. **Further Feature Engineering**:
   - Since the model struggles with capturing volatility, you could experiment with additional derived features, such as momentum indicators, or technical indicators like Bollinger Bands, which are specifically designed to capture price volatility.

5. **Model Validation with Cross-Validation**:
   - Running the model with cross-validation can help ensure that it generalizes well across different segments of the data, allowing you to identify any overfitting to specific time frames or market conditions.

These steps can help enhance the model’s ability to capture detailed patterns in price movements and improve its predictive performance in volatile periods. Let me know if you’d like further guidance on implementing these adjustments!
