How to use it:

Save the code: Save the modified code as estimate_chunk_size.py.

Run the script: Execute the script from your terminal:

Bash
python estimate_chunk_size.py
Use code with caution.

Enter the directory: The script will prompt you to enter the target directory. Provide the path to the directory containing your .txt chunk files (e.g., /home/smduck/programs/temp_txtllm_postprogem9bq8/).

Enter the word count:  Next, it will ask you for the total word count. Enter the number you obtained from the cat ... | wc -w command.

The script will then calculate and print the estimated average chunk size. This interactive approach makes it more user-friendly and adaptable to different directories and word counts.







python3 estimate_chunk_sizev2.py 

Enter the target directory: /home/smduck/programs/temp_txtllm_postprogem9bq8/

Enter the total word count: 5868709

Estimated average chunk size: 554.33 words

It looks like the script worked perfectly!

You provided the following:

Target directory: /home/smduck/programs/temp_txtllm_postprogem9bq8/
Total word count: 5,868,709
And the script calculated:

Estimated average chunk size: 554.33 words
Interpretation:

This means that, on average, each .txt file (chunk) in your /home/smduck/programs/temp_txtllm_postprogem9bq8/ directory contains approximately 554 words.

Comparison to CHUNK_SIZE:

Remember that you initially set CHUNK_SIZE to 3000 in your process_filessmd.sh script. This indicates that your actual chunk sizes are much smaller than your intended size.

Possible reasons for the difference:

Sentence Length: If the text you're processing has many short sentences, the chunking process might create smaller chunks than expected.
Whitespace: Extra whitespace or line breaks in your text could also contribute to smaller chunk sizes.
Tokenization: Keep in mind that language models work with tokens, not words. A single word might be split into multiple tokens, so the actual number of tokens per chunk might be higher than the word count suggests.
Next Steps:

Adjust CHUNK_SIZE: If you want larger chunks, increase the CHUNK_SIZE value in your process_filessmd.sh script.
Analyze Chunk Content: Examine a few chunk files to see if the text divisions make sense and if the chunks contain coherent blocks of information.
Monitor GPU Usage: As you adjust CHUNK_SIZE and potentially increase the context_window, continue monitoring your GPU memory usage (nvtop) to ensure you're not exceeding the model's limits.
Evaluate Output: Most importantly, assess the quality of the model's output (algorithm extraction, pseudocode generation) to see how the changes affect its performance.
