Subject: Explaining My Software Project Tonight

Hi Mom,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to give you a quick update on what I'm working on this evening.

I'm currently working on a software project that involves processing text files using a machine learning model. The goal is to classify these text files into different categories (like "science," "law," "biology," etc.) and calculate how similar each text is to these categories. This helps in understanding the content of the text files better.

To do this, I'm using a powerful tool called "BART," which is a type of machine learning model developed by Facebook. It's quite advanced and can understand and classify text based on the categories I specify.

However, I ran into a small issue with permissions on my computer. The directory where I need to save the results of this processing is owned by the "root" user, which means I don't have the necessary permissions to write files there. So, I'm making some adjustments to change the ownership of the directory to my user account, which will allow me to save the results properly.

Once I've sorted out the permissions, I'll run the script to process the text files and generate the classification results. These results will be saved in a CSV file and a JSON file, which I can then analyze further.

I know this might sound a bit technical, but it's all part of the exciting work I do with software and machine learning!

Thanks for your support, Mom! I'll let you know how it goes.

Best,
Jeb
