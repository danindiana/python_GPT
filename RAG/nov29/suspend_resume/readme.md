Subject: Explaining My Software Project Tonight

Hi Mom,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to give you a quick update on what I'm working on this evening.

I'm currently working on a software project that involves processing text files using a machine learning model. The goal is to classify these text files into different categories (like "science," "law," "biology," etc.) and calculate how similar each text is to these categories. This helps in understanding the content of the text files better.

To do this, I'm using a powerful tool called "BART," which is a type of machine learning model developed by Facebook. It's quite advanced and can understand and classify text based on the categories I specify.

However, I ran into a small issue with permissions on my computer. The directory where I need to save the results of this processing is owned by the "root" user, which means I don't have the necessary permissions to write files there. So, I'm making some adjustments to change the ownership of the directory to my user account, which will allow me to save the results properly.

Once I've sorted out the permissions, I'll run the script to process the text files and generate the classification results. These results will be saved in a CSV file and a JSON file, which I can then analyze further.

I know this might sound a bit technical, but it's all part of the exciting work I do with software and machine learning!

Thanks for your support, Mom! I'll let you know how it goes.

Best,
Jeb

Hi Mom,

I wanted to explain what I'm working on in software this evening. I'm writing a program that helps computers understand and categorize text files. Think of it like a super-smart assistant that can read and figure out what a bunch of text files are about, even if it hasn't seen those specific topics before.

Here's what I'm doing step-by-step:

1. **Reading Text Files**: I'm asking the program to look at a folder full of text files. Each file contains some written content, like a story, an article, or notes.

2. **Understanding the Content**: The program uses some advanced tools (called "models") to read and understand the text. It can figure out what the text is about, even if it's about something new or unusual.

3. **Categorizing the Text**: Once the program understands the text, it tries to put it into categories. For example, if the text is about science, it will label it as "science." If it's about law, it will label it as "law."

4. **Measuring Similarity**: After categorizing, the program also checks how similar the text is to the categories it chose. This helps make sure the categorization is accurate.

5. **Saving the Results**: Finally, the program saves the results in two formats: a CSV file (like a spreadsheet) and a JSON file (a format that computers can easily read). This way, I can look at the results later and see how well the program did.

6. **Resuming Work**: If something happens and I need to stop the program, it will remember which files it has already processed. This way, I can start again from where I left off without losing any work.

I hope this gives you a good idea of what I'm working on! It's a bit technical, but it's really interesting and useful for helping computers understand human language better.

Thanks for your support!

Love,

Hi Mom,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to take a moment to explain what I'm working on in software this evening.

I'm currently working on a project that involves converting documents, specifically PDF files, into text that can be easily read and analyzed by computers. This process is called Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The goal is to make it easier to search and understand the content of these documents.

However, some of these documents contain complex mathematical equations and symbols, which are often written in a special format called LaTeX. LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used in academic and scientific papers to format equations and other complex text.

My task tonight is to improve the software so that it can better recognize and convert these mathematical symbols and equations into a format that can be understood by both humans and computers. This involves using specialized OCR techniques and tools designed to handle mathematical content.

I'll be working on enhancing the image preprocessing steps to make the symbols clearer, using a specialized OCR model that's trained to recognize mathematical notation, and then post-processing the extracted text to ensure it's accurate and in the correct format.

This project is a bit technical, but it's important for making scientific and academic research more accessible and easier to analyze. I'll be focusing on this for the evening, but I'll make sure to take breaks and keep you updated on my progress.

Thanks for your support, Mom!

Love,

Hi Mom,

I hope you're doing well! Just wanted to give you a quick update on what I'll be working on in software this evening.

I'm focusing on improving a special kind of computer program that helps it understand and respond to questions better. Think of it like a super-smart assistant that can help with tasks or answer questions, but it needs to get smarter over time.

Tonight, I'm working on making this assistant learn from new information and user feedback. This means it will get better at understanding what people are asking and giving more accurate answers. It's like teaching a child to learn from their experiences—the more they practice and get feedback, the better they become.

I'm also making sure this assistant can handle different languages and adapt to new situations quickly. This way, it can be more useful to more people, no matter where they are or what language they speak.

It's a bit technical, but the end goal is to create something that can help people more effectively and efficiently. I'll be diving into the code and tweaking some settings to make this happen.

Thanks for always being interested in what I do! I'll let you know how it goes.

Take care,

Hi Mom,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to give you a quick update on what I'm working on in software this evening.

I'm currently building a system that helps predict the future prices of cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This is important because it allows me to identify opportunities to buy and sell these digital currencies at the right times to make a profit. Think of it like trying to guess the best time to buy and sell stocks, but for these new types of money that exist online.

To do this, I'm using some advanced computer models that learn from past data, kind of like how you might remember what happens when it rains after a few sunny days. These models help me see patterns and make better guesses about what will happen next.

I'm also making sure this system can work quickly and automatically, so it can react to changes in the market almost instantly. This way, I don't have to sit in front of the computer all day watching the prices.

It's a bit technical, but the goal is to create something that can help me make smarter decisions and hopefully earn some extra money. I'm excited about it because it combines my interest in computers with the chance to learn more about finance and investing.

I'll keep you posted on how it goes! Thanks for always being supportive.

Take care,

Hi Mom,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to explain what I'm working on with my computer this evening.

I'm setting up a backup system for my computer's main hard drive. This is important because it ensures that if anything goes wrong with my computer—like a hard drive failure or accidental deletion of important files—I can easily restore everything.

To do this, I'm using a tool called Restic, which is a program that helps me copy all the important data from my computer to another computer on our home network. This other computer is called "dellserver," and it has a large storage space where I can keep these backups safe.

Here's a quick breakdown of what I'm doing:

1. **Installing Restic**: I'm making sure that the Restic program is installed on both my computer (called "worlock") and the "dellserver."

2. **Creating a Backup Repository**: On the "dellserver," I'm creating a special folder where all the backups will be stored. This folder is named "tricorn."

3. **Setting Up SSH Access**: I'm configuring a secure way for my computer to communicate with the "dellserver" over the network. This is done using a method called SSH, which ensures that the data transfer is safe and secure.

4. **Performing the Backup**: I'm running a command on my computer that tells Restic to copy all the important data from my main hard drive to the "dellserver." This process is being done with extra details (verbose output) so I can monitor it closely.

5. **Automating the Backup**: To make sure this backup happens regularly without me having to do it manually every time, I'm setting up a schedule using a tool called cron. This will automatically run the backup every day at 2 AM.

6. **Verifying the Backup**: After the backup is done, I'll check to make sure everything was copied correctly by listing all the backups stored on the "dellserver."

This setup will give me peace of mind knowing that my important data is safely backed up and can be restored if needed.

Thanks for understanding! Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
