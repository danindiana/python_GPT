Hereâ€™s a Perl script that reads the **CSV file** generated by your Python script, processes the classification scores and cosine similarity values, and calculates a combined, easy-to-understand score for each document.

The script will output a new CSV file with the additional scores and helpful metrics.

### **Perl Script: `process_csv_scores.pl`**

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Text::CSV;

# Input and output file names
my $input_file  = "classification_results_with_similarity.csv";
my $output_file = "processed_document_scores.csv";

# Open input file for reading
open my $in_fh, "<", $input_file or die "Could not open '$input_file': $!";
my $csv_in = Text::CSV->new({ binary => 1 }) or die "Cannot use CSV: " . Text::CSV->error_diag();
$csv_in->getline($in_fh); # Skip the header row

# Open output file for writing
open my $out_fh, ">", $output_file or die "Could not open '$output_file': $!";
my $csv_out = Text::CSV->new({ binary => 1, eol => $/ });

# Write new header to output CSV
$csv_out->print($out_fh, ["File Name", "Label", "Score", "Cosine Similarity", "Combined Score", "Interpretation"]);

# Process each row in the input CSV
while (my $row = $csv_in->getline($in_fh)) {
    my ($file_name, $label, $score, $cosine_similarity) = @$row;

    # Calculate a combined score: weighted average of classification score and cosine similarity
    my $combined_score = (0.7 * $score) + (0.3 * $cosine_similarity);

    # Interpret the combined score
    my $interpretation;
    if ($combined_score >= 0.8) {
        $interpretation = "Highly Relevant";
    } elsif ($combined_score >= 0.5) {
        $interpretation = "Moderately Relevant";
    } else {
        $interpretation = "Less Relevant";
    }

    # Write the row to the output file
    $csv_out->print($out_fh, [$file_name, $label, $score, $cosine_similarity, sprintf("%.4f", $combined_score), $interpretation]);
}

# Close file handles
close $in_fh or die "Could not close '$input_file': $!";
close $out_fh or die "Could not close '$output_file': $!";

print "Processing complete. Output saved to '$output_file'.\n";
```

### **What This Script Does**

1. **Reads the Input CSV**:
   - Assumes the CSV contains columns: `File Name`, `Label`, `Score`, and `Cosine Similarity`.

2. **Calculates a Combined Score**:
   - Combines the **classification score** and **cosine similarity** using a weighted average:
     - 70% weight to the classification score.
     - 30% weight to the cosine similarity.
   - The weights can be adjusted based on your use case.

3. **Generates an Interpretation**:
   - Adds an easy-to-understand interpretation based on the combined score:
     - **Highly Relevant**: `>= 0.8`
     - **Moderately Relevant**: `>= 0.5 and < 0.8`
     - **Less Relevant**: `< 0.5`

4. **Writes a New CSV**:
   - Outputs the processed data to a new file (`processed_document_scores.csv`) with the following columns:
     - File Name
     - Label
     - Score
     - Cosine Similarity
     - Combined Score
     - Interpretation

### **Example Input**

**`classification_results_with_similarity.csv`**
```csv
File Name,Label,Score,Cosine Similarity
example1.txt,science,0.8943,0.9123
example1.txt,technology,0.7321,0.8412
example2.txt,law,0.8712,0.8123
example2.txt,biology,0.4512,0.7641
```

---

### **Example Output**

**`processed_document_scores.csv`**
```csv
File Name,Label,Score,Cosine Similarity,Combined Score,Interpretation
example1.txt,science,0.8943,0.9123,0.8990,Highly Relevant
example1.txt,technology,0.7321,0.8412,0.7637,Moderately Relevant
example2.txt,law,0.8712,0.8123,0.8572,Highly Relevant
example2.txt,biology,0.4512,0.7641,0.5560,Moderately Relevant
```

### **How to Use the Script**

1. **Save the Script**:
   Save the script as `process_csv_scores.pl`.

2. **Install Required Perl Module**:
   If `Text::CSV` is not already installed, you can install it via CPAN:
   ```bash
   cpan Text::CSV
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   perl process_csv_scores.pl
   ```

4. **Check the Output**:
   - The output will be saved as `processed_document_scores.csv` in the same directory.

---

### **Customizing the Script**
- **Adjust Weights**: Modify the `0.7` and `0.3` in the `combined_score` calculation to prioritize classification or similarity.
- **Change Interpretation Thresholds**: Update the ranges for "Highly Relevant," "Moderately Relevant," and "Less Relevant" as needed.

The **classification score** and **cosine similarity score** each represent different aspects of how a document relates to a label. Depending on your goals and the nature of your task, you may prioritize one over the other.

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**              | **Classification Score**                                     | **Cosine Similarity**                                |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **What it Measures**     | Confidence in how well the text matches the label/task as understood by the model. | Semantic closeness between the text and label based on vector embeddings. |
| **Source**               | Generated by the **classification model** (e.g., `facebook/bart-large-mnli`). | Calculated using **embeddings** from a separate language model (e.g., `sentence-transformers`). |
| **Task-Specific**        | Tailored to the task (e.g., zero-shot classification with pre-trained knowledge). | More generic, based on the overall semantic content of the text and label. |
| **Scale**                | Values range between 0 and 1 (softmax probabilities).       | Values range from -1 to 1 (cosine similarity).     |
| **Interpretation**       | Indicates the model's confidence that the text belongs to the label. | Measures how "close" or "similar" the text and label are in vector space. |

### **Why Might You Prefer One Over the Other?**

#### **1. Prefer Classification Scores When:**
- **Task-Specific Knowledge is Important**:
  - If the classification model was trained to handle the nuances of certain tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic categorization), itâ€™s better equipped to make decisions based on that knowledge.
  - Example: If the task is to categorize legal documents into specific law domains, the classification model can use task-specific cues.
  
- **You Trust the Classifier's Pre-Trained Capabilities**:
  - The model has been pre-trained on diverse tasks, giving it a wide but informed understanding of how certain labels relate to text.

- **Speed is Important**:
  - Computing classification scores is typically faster since embeddings and similarity computations involve additional steps.

---

#### **2. Prefer Cosine Similarity Scores When:**
- **Semantic Context Matters**:
  - Cosine similarity directly measures how semantically close the text is to the label, making it ideal for tasks that emphasize meaning over specific label-task mappings.
  - Example: If youâ€™re clustering articles on science and technology, "engineering" might not explicitly match "technology" via classification, but cosine similarity could reveal their semantic closeness.

- **Labels are Abstract or Generic**:
  - If your labels are broad and not task-specific (e.g., "good," "bad"), embeddings and cosine similarity can capture subtler relationships.

- **Youâ€™re Exploring New Domains**:
  - In cases where pre-trained classification models lack knowledge about the domain, embeddings provide a more flexible way to measure relevance.

---

### **Why Use Both?**
Combining classification and cosine similarity allows you to leverage the strengths of both approaches:
- **Classification Scores**: Provide a task-specific, probabilistic match for the label.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Adds an additional layer of validation by measuring semantic alignment.

For example:
- **High Classification + High Cosine Similarity**: Strong match, relevant in both the task and semantic sense.
- **High Classification + Low Cosine Similarity**: Likely task-relevant but semantically different (e.g., nuanced domain knowledge).
- **Low Classification + High Cosine Similarity**: Semantically similar but possibly outside the taskâ€™s scope.

---

### **When to Adjust Weights**
In tasks where:
- **Precision matters** (e.g., legal categorization): Favor **classification scores** more heavily (e.g., 80% classification, 20% similarity).
- **Semantic generality is critical** (e.g., document clustering): Favor **cosine similarity** more heavily (e.g., 30% classification, 70% similarity).

---

### **Summary**
- Classification tells you **how confident the model is** in matching the text to the label for a specific task.
- Cosine similarity tells you **how semantically similar** the text and label are, based on their overall meaning.
- By balancing these scores, you can adapt your system to prioritize precision, semantic relevance, or both.
