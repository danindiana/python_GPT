A `SentenceTransformer` model that works for embedding generation typically consists of two main components:

1. **Pre-trained Transformer Backbone**: A base transformer model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or any Hugging Face model) fine-tuned for tasks like sentence similarity or embedding generation.
2. **Pooling Layer**: A mechanism to pool the outputs of the transformer into a single fixed-size dense vector for each sentence.

Here's what a typical structure looks like:

---

### **Components of a SentenceTransformer for Embeddings**

1. **Transformer Model**:
   - Pre-trained transformer from Hugging Face (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa).
   - The transformer encodes each token into contextualized embeddings.

2. **Pooling Layer**:
   - After the transformer processes a sentence, a pooling mechanism combines token embeddings into a single dense vector (sentence embedding).
   - Common pooling strategies:
     - **Mean Pooling**: Average over all token embeddings.
     - **CLS Token**: Use the embedding of the `[CLS]` token (if applicable).
     - **Max Pooling**: Use the maximum value over all token embeddings.

---

### **Code Example: A Custom SentenceTransformer Model**

Below is an example of how to define a simple `SentenceTransformer` model for embeddings:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, models

# Step 1: Load a transformer model (e.g., BERT)
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
word_embedding_model = models.Transformer(model_name)

# Step 2: Define a pooling layer
pooling_model = models.Pooling(
    word_embedding_model.get_word_embedding_dimension(),
    pooling_mode_mean_tokens=True,  # Use mean pooling
    pooling_mode_cls_token=False,
    pooling_mode_max_tokens=False,
)

# Step 3: Combine the transformer and pooling layer into a SentenceTransformer model
sentence_embedding_model = SentenceTransformer(modules=[word_embedding_model, pooling_model])

# Test the model
sentences = ["This is a test sentence.", "Sentence Transformers are powerful."]
embeddings = sentence_embedding_model.encode(sentences)

print(f"Embeddings shape: {embeddings.shape}")
```

---

### **How This Model Works**
1. **Transformer Model**:
   - Each token in a sentence is mapped to a vector in high-dimensional space, considering the context of the entire sentence.

2. **Pooling**:
   - The token embeddings are combined into a single fixed-size vector for the sentence using the pooling strategy.

3. **Embedding**:
   - The final sentence embedding is a dense vector that represents the meaning of the sentence in the embedding space.

---

### **Using a Pre-Trained SentenceTransformer**
If you don't need to define your own model, you can use a pre-trained model from the `sentence-transformers` library. Some popular pre-trained models include:

- `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`: Efficient and widely used for general-purpose embeddings.
- `"paraphrase-MiniLM-L12-v2"`: Optimized for sentence similarity.
- `"stsb-roberta-large"`: Fine-tuned on STS benchmark for semantic similarity tasks.

#### Example:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Load a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model
model_name = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"  # Replace with your desired model
model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)

# Generate embeddings
sentences = ["This is an example sentence.", "Each sentence is converted into a vector."]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)

print(f"Embeddings shape: {embeddings.shape}")
```

---

### **Embedding Workflow in Multi-GPU Context**
For your multi-GPU setup, a model like this will:
1. Encode sentences into embeddings (dense vectors).
2. Use pre-trained or custom pooling mechanisms.
3. Allow efficient processing with distributed workloads using tools like `device_map="auto"` or manual GPU allocation.

We are NOT building or using a custom SentenceTransformer, ensure it we want to use whatever is going to work here:
- Supports Hugging Face transformers.
- Has a pooling mechanism for generating embeddings.

I need to generate sentence embeddings using a SentenceTransformer model in a multi-GPU environment.

The system has two GPUs: an RTX 3080 and an RTX 3060.

I should ensure that the model can utilize both GPUs efficiently.

I want to use a pre-trained model from the sentence-transformers library.

I don't need to build a custom model; I can use one that's available.

I should choose a model that supports Hugging Face transformers and has a pooling mechanism.

Popular pre-trained models include "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" and "paraphrase-MiniLM-L12-v2".

I need to make sure the code runs on multiple GPUs.

I can use PyTorch's DataParallel or DDP for multi-GPU training.

But since I'm generating embeddings, DataParallel might be sufficient.

I should check if sentence-transformers supports multi-GPU inference.

I recall that sentence-transformers can utilize multiple GPUs by setting device_map="auto".

I need to install the necessary libraries: sentence-transformers and transformers.

I should write code to load the pre-trained model and generate embeddings for some sentences.

I can test the embeddings by checking their shape and ensuring they are correctly computed.

I should also consider the batch size to optimize GPU memory usage.

I might need to adjust the batch size depending on the GPU memory available.

I can refer to the sentence-transformers documentation for more details.

I should also be aware of the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable.

Setting it can help control which GPUs are used by the application.

I need to make sure that PyTorch recognizes both GPUs.

I can check torch.cuda.device_count() to see how many GPUs are available.

I should also handle exceptions in case there are issues with GPU allocation.

Finally, I should test the code to ensure it runs without errors and produces the expected output.

To generate sentence embeddings using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model in a multi-GPU environment, follow these steps:

Install Necessary Libraries:

Ensure you have the sentence-transformers and transformers libraries installed:

bash
Copy
pip install sentence-transformers transformers
Choose a Pre-Trained Model:

Select a pre-trained model from the sentence-transformers library. For example, "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" is efficient and widely used.

Load the Model and Utilize Multiple GPUs:

Use the device_map="auto" parameter to allow the model to utilize all available GPUs efficiently.

Generate Sentence Embeddings:

Encode your sentences to obtain their embeddings.

Verify the Output:

Check the shape of the embeddings to ensure they are correctly generated.

Here is the complete code:

python
Copy
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch

# Step 1: Choose a pre-trained model
model_name = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Step 2: Load the pre-trained SentenceTransformer model
# Utilize all available GPUs by setting device_map="auto"
model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda", device_map="auto")

# Step 3: Generate embeddings for sentences
sentences = [
    "This is an example sentence.",
    "Each sentence is converted into a vector.",
    "Sentence Transformers are powerful."
]

# Encode the sentences
embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)

# Step 4: Verify the output
print(f"Embeddings shape: {embeddings.shape}")

# Optional: Print the embeddings
# print(embeddings)
Notes:

Multi-GPU Utilization:

The device_map="auto" argument automatically distributes the model across all available GPUs.

The device="cuda" argument specifies that the model should be loaded onto the GPU(s).

Adjusting Batch Size:

Set an appropriate batch_size to avoid GPU memory overflow.

Adjust based on the amount of GPU memory available (e.g., 1004MiB and 59MiB in your case might suggest careful management).

Environment Variables:

You can control which GPUs are visible to the application using CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.

For example: export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 to use both GPUs.

Checking GPU Availability:

Verify that PyTorch can access multiple GPUs:

python
Copy
print(f"Number of GPUs available: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
Handling Exceptions:

Ensure error handling is in place to catch and handle any GPU allocation issues.

Hugging Face Transformers Multi-GPU Usage

PyTorch Multi-GPU

By following these steps, you can efficiently generate sentence embeddings using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model across multiple GPUs in your setup.

OK we want that code to prompt the user to enter a directory of text, json files and recursively generate embeddings from that target directory.
To prompt the user to enter a directory containing text or JSON files and recursively generate embeddings from that directory, you can follow these steps:

Prompt the User for the Directory:

Use input() to get the directory path from the user.

Recursively Process Files:

Use os.walk() to traverse the directory and its subdirectories.

Check if the file is a text or JSON file.

Read and Process Files:

Read the content of text files directly.

For JSON files, read the content and extract relevant text data.

Generate Embeddings:

Use the SentenceTransformer model to generate embeddings for the text content.

Save or Use the Embeddings:

Optionally, save the embeddings to a file or use them directly in your application.

Here is the complete code:

python
Copy
import os
import json
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Step 1: Choose a pre-trained model
model_name = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Step 2: Load the pre-trained SentenceTransformer model
# Utilize all available GPUs by setting device_map="auto"
model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda", device_map="auto")

# Step 3: Prompt the user for the directory
directory = input("Enter the directory containing text or JSON files: ")

# Step 4: Recursively process files in the directory
def process_directory(directory):
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            if file.endswith(".txt"):
                process_text_file(file_path)
            elif file.endswith(".json"):
                process_json_file(file_path)

def process_text_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        text_content = file.read()
        sentences = text_content.split('\n')
        generate_embeddings(sentences)

def process_json_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        json_content = json.load(file)
        # Assuming the JSON structure is a list of sentences or a dictionary with a 'text' key
        if isinstance(json_content, list):
            sentences = json_content
        elif isinstance(json_content, dict) and 'text' in json_content:
            sentences = json_content['text'].split('\n')
        else:
            print(f"Skipping JSON file {file_path} due to unsupported format.")
            return
        generate_embeddings(sentences)

def generate_embeddings(sentences):
    if sentences:
        embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)
        print(f"Embeddings shape: {embeddings.shape}")
        # Optionally, save the embeddings to a file or use them directly
        # For example: np.save('embeddings.npy', embeddings)

# Step 5: Start processing the directory
process_directory(directory)
Notes:

File Handling:

The code assumes that text files contain plain text and JSON files contain either a list of sentences or a dictionary with a 'text' key.

Adjust the JSON processing logic based on your specific JSON structure.

Error Handling:

Add error handling for file reading and JSON parsing to manage unexpected issues gracefully.

Batch Size:

Adjust the batch_size based on your GPU memory capacity.

Saving Embeddings:

Uncomment and modify the np.save('embeddings.npy', embeddings) line to save the embeddings to a file using NumPy.

By following these steps, you can recursively generate embeddings from a directory of text or JSON files using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model across multiple GPUs.

model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda", device_map="auto")
            
TypeError: SentenceTransformer.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device_map'
Alright, I'm trying to run this code to generate sentence embeddings using a pre-trained model from the sentence_transformers library. I have a multi-GPU setup, and I want to utilize all available GPUs efficiently. The code I have is:

model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda", device_map="auto")

But when I run it, I get this error:

TypeError: SentenceTransformer.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device_map'

Hmm, okay, so it seems like the SentenceTransformer class doesn't accept a 'device_map' argument in its __init__ method. I remember reading that in the Hugging Face Transformers library, some models accept a 'device_map' parameter for multi-GPU usage, but maybe the sentence_transformers library doesn't support it directly.

Let me check the documentation for SentenceTransformer. I'll look up the official documentation or maybe the GitHub page for sentence_transformers. According to the documentation, the SentenceTransformer class initializes with modules, and it has a 'device' parameter to specify the device.

Wait, maybe 'device_map' is not a valid parameter for SentenceTransformer. Perhaps it's specific to the Hugging Face's AutoModel classes.

I recall that the sentence_transformers library builds on top of Hugging Face's transformers library but has its own way of handling devices and multi-GPU setups. So, maybe I need to configure it differently.

Let me try initializing the model without the 'device_map' parameter:

model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda")

Does that work? If my system has multiple GPUs, will it utilize them all?

I should check how sentence_transformers handles multi-GPU. Maybe there's a different approach to distribute the model across multiple GPUs.

I found that in sentence_transformers, to use multiple GPUs, you can wrap the model with DataParallel or use the accelerate library. But I'm not sure about the exact implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set the device to "cuda" and let PyTorch handle the GPU allocation.

Also, I need to make sure that PyTorch is configured to see all my GPUs. I can check that by printing torch.cuda.device_count().

Let me add that to my code:

import torch

print(f"Number of GPUs available: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")

Okay, it prints 2, which matches the GPUs I have.

Maybe I don't need to specify 'device_map' at all. Let me try removing it and see what happens.

So, updating the code:

model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda")

Now, does this utilize both GPUs? I'm not sure. I need to test it.

I should also look into the sentence_transformers' documentation for multi-GPU usage. Maybe there's a recommended way.

I found that sentence_transformers supports the accelerate library for multi-GPU training, but for inference, it might be sufficient to set device="cuda".

Alternatively, I can try to use the DataParallel wrapper from PyTorch.

Something like:

model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)

model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model)

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach, as SentenceTransformer might have its own way of handling parallelization.

Wait, perhaps I should initialize the model without DataParallel and let the encode() function handle the batch distribution.

I need to check if the encode() method in SentenceTransformer can handle large batches by itself.

Looking at the documentation, the encode() method has parameters like batch_size and show_progress_bar.

Maybe I should just set a reasonable batch_size and let it handle the rest.

Also, I should make sure that I'm using the latest version of sentence_transformers and transformers libraries.

I can check the versions:

import sentence_transformers

print(sentence_transformers.__version__)

import transformers

print(transformers.__version__)

If they are outdated, I might need to update them using pip install --upgrade sentence_transformers transformers.

Assuming they are up to date, let's proceed.

Another thought: maybe I should use the device parameter without 'device_map', as 'device_map' is not recognized.

Also, perhaps I can set os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] to specify which GPUs to use.

For example:

import os

os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0,1"

Then, set device="cuda".

But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, I can try to use the accelerate library to manage multi-GPU inference.

I can try importing accelerate and initializing the accelerator.

But that might be more involved.

Maybe for now, I'll try initializing the model without 'device_map' and see if it works.

If it only uses one GPU, then I'll look for ways to utilize multiple GPUs.

Also, I should consider the size of my embeddings and the memory constraints of each GPU.

If my batch_size is too large, it might not fit into a single GPU's memory, causing errors.

So, I need to monitor the memory usage and adjust the batch_size accordingly.

In summary, my plan is:

1. Remove the 'device_map' parameter from SentenceTransformer initialization.

2. Set device="cuda" to use all available GPUs.

3. Check if the model utilizes multiple GPUs during inference.

4. If not, look into alternative methods like DataParallel or accelerate for multi-GPU utilization.

5. Ensure that my batch_size is appropriate for the GPU memory available.

6. Update the libraries to the latest versions if necessary.

I'll implement these steps and see how it goes.

To resolve the error and effectively utilize multiple GPUs for generating sentence embeddings, follow these steps:

Remove the device_map parameter: The SentenceTransformer class does not accept device_map as a keyword argument.

Set the device parameter to "cuda": This allows the model to utilize GPUs.

Check GPU availability and count: Ensure PyTorch recognizes all available GPUs.

Consider using DataParallel or accelerate for multi-GPU inference: If necessary, to distribute the model across multiple GPUs.

Adjust batch_size for GPU memory constraints: Ensure the batch size is suitable for the GPU memory available.

Here is the corrected code:

python
Copy
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch

# Step 1: Choose a pre-trained model
model_name = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Step 2: Load the pre-trained SentenceTransformer model
# Utilize GPUs by setting device="cuda"
model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda")

# Step 3: Check the number of GPUs available
print(f"Number of GPUs available: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")

# Step 4: (Optional) Use DataParallel for multi-GPU inference
# model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model)

# Step 5: Generate embeddings for sentences
sentences = [
    "This is an example sentence.",
    "Each sentence is converted into a vector.",
    "Sentence Transformers are powerful."
]

# Encode the sentences with an appropriate batch_size
embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)

# Step 6: Verify the output
print(f"Embeddings shape: {embeddings.shape}")
Notes:

Removing device_map: The parameter is not recognized by SentenceTransformer, so it should be removed.

Utilizing Multiple GPUs: Setting device="cuda" allows the model to use all available GPUs. PyTorch handles GPU allocation automatically.

DataParallel: Uncomment the DataParallel line if you encounter issues with multi-GPU inference.

Batch Size Adjustment: Ensure the batch_size is appropriate for your GPU memory to avoid out-of-memory errors.

Library Versions: Make sure you have the latest versions of sentence_transformers and transformers for optimal performance.

By following these steps, you should be able to generate sentence embeddings using multiple GPUs without encountering the TypeError.

Explain what the batch_size means for this code/use case.
In the context of generating sentence embeddings using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model, the batch_size parameter controls how many sentences are processed together in a single forward pass through the model. Here's a detailed explanation of what batch_size means for this code/use case:

What is batch_size?
Definition: batch_size is the number of sentences that are processed simultaneously in one iteration of the model.

Purpose: Processing sentences in batches allows for more efficient use of computational resources, especially when working with large datasets or models.

Why is batch_size Important?
Memory Efficiency:

GPU Memory: Processing sentences in batches helps manage GPU memory usage. If you process too many sentences at once, you might run out of GPU memory, leading to out-of-memory errors.

CPU Memory: Similarly, processing large batches can also consume significant CPU memory, especially if the sentences are very long or numerous.

Computational Efficiency:

Parallel Processing: Modern GPUs are optimized for parallel processing. By processing multiple sentences in parallel (i.e., in a batch), you can take full advantage of the GPU's parallel processing capabilities, leading to faster computation times.

Overhead Reduction: Processing sentences one by one (batch size of 1) incurs more overhead due to the repeated setup and teardown of computational resources for each sentence. Larger batches reduce this overhead.

Choosing an Appropriate batch_size
Small Batch Size:

Pros: Reduces memory usage, making it suitable for systems with limited GPU memory.

Cons: May not fully utilize the GPU's parallel processing capabilities, leading to slower overall computation times.

Large Batch Size:

Pros: Maximizes GPU utilization, leading to faster computation times.

Cons: Requires more GPU memory, which can lead to out-of-memory errors if the batch size is too large for the available memory.

Example in the Code
In the provided code, the batch_size is set to 32:

python
Copy
embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)
Considerations for Setting batch_size
GPU Memory:

Check the available GPU memory using torch.cuda.memory_allocated() or nvidia-smi.

Adjust the batch_size based on the available memory. For example, if you have 16GB of GPU memory, you might start with a batch_size of 32 and adjust based on memory usage.

Sentence Length:

Longer sentences consume more memory. If your sentences are very long, consider reducing the batch_size.

System Performance:

Experiment with different batch_size values to find the optimal balance between memory usage and computational efficiency.

Example Adjustment
If you find that a batch_size of 32 is causing out-of-memory errors, you might reduce it to 16 or even lower:

python
Copy
embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=16, show_progress_bar=True)
Summary
batch_size controls the number of sentences processed together in one forward pass through the model.

Memory Efficiency: Larger batches require more memory, while smaller batches reduce memory usage.

Computational Efficiency: Larger batches can lead to faster computation times by better utilizing GPU parallel processing capabilities.

Adjust batch_size based on available GPU memory, sentence length, and system performance.

By understanding and appropriately setting the batch_size, you can optimize the performance of generating sentence embeddings using the SentenceTransformer model.

What other elements can add here? Can we adjust the dimensionality of the embedding output as well or...?
Certainly! There are several elements you can add or adjust to further customize and optimize the embedding generation process. Here are some additional features and adjustments you can consider:

1. Adjusting the Dimensionality of the Embedding Output
The dimensionality of the embedding output is determined by the model architecture. For example, models like "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" typically output embeddings of size 384. If you need a different dimensionality, you can:

Use a Different Pre-trained Model: Choose a model that outputs embeddings of the desired dimensionality.

Post-process the Embeddings: Apply a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA or t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings.

2. Saving Embeddings to Disk
You can save the generated embeddings to disk for later use. This is particularly useful if you are processing a large dataset and want to avoid recomputing embeddings.

python
Copy
import numpy as np

def save_embeddings(embeddings, file_path):
    np.save(file_path, embeddings)

def generate_embeddings(sentences):
    if sentences:
        embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)
        print(f"Embeddings shape: {embeddings.shape}")
        save_embeddings(embeddings, 'embeddings.npy')
3. Error Handling
Add error handling to manage unexpected issues gracefully, such as file reading errors or JSON parsing errors.

python
Copy
import os
import json
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Choose a pre-trained model
model_name = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Step 2: Load the pre-trained SentenceTransformer model
# Utilize GPUs by setting device="cuda"
model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda")

# Step 3: Check the number of GPUs available
print(f"Number of GPUs available: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")

# Step 4: Prompt the user for the directory
directory = input("Enter the directory containing text or JSON files: ")

# Step 5: Recursively process files in the directory
def process_directory(directory):
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            try:
                if file.endswith(".txt"):
                    process_text_file(file_path)
                elif file.endswith(".json"):
                    process_json_file(file_path)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error processing file {file_path}: {e}")

def process_text_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            text_content = file.read()
            sentences = text_content.split('\n')
            generate_embeddings(sentences)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading text file {file_path}: {e}")

def process_json_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            json_content = json.load(file)
            # Assuming the JSON structure is a list of sentences or a dictionary with a 'text' key
            if isinstance(json_content, list):
                sentences = json_content
            elif isinstance(json_content, dict) and 'text' in json_content:
                sentences = json_content['text'].split('\n')
            else:
                print(f"Skipping JSON file {file_path} due to unsupported format.")
                return
            generate_embeddings(sentences)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading JSON file {file_path}: {e}")

def generate_embeddings(sentences):
    if sentences:
        embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)
        print(f"Embeddings shape: {embeddings.shape}")
        save_embeddings(embeddings, 'embeddings.npy')

def save_embeddings(embeddings, file_path):
    np.save(file_path, embeddings)

# Step 6: Start processing the directory
process_directory(directory)
4. Logging and Progress Tracking
Add logging to track the progress and any errors encountered during the processing.

python
Copy
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def process_directory(directory):
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            try:
                if file.endswith(".txt"):
                    logging.info(f"Processing text file: {file_path}")
                    process_text_file(file_path)
                elif file.endswith(".json"):
                    logging.info(f"Processing JSON file: {file_path}")
                    process_json_file(file_path)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Error processing file {file_path}: {e}")
5. Parallel Processing
If you have multiple CPU cores, you can use parallel processing to speed up the file reading and processing.

python
Copy
import concurrent.futures

def process_directory(directory):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = []
        for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
            for file in files:
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                if file.endswith(".txt"):
                    futures.append(executor.submit(process_text_file, file_path))
                elif file.endswith(".json"):
                    futures.append(executor.submit(process_json_file, file_path))
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            try:
                future.result()
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Error processing file: {e}")
6. Custom Pooling Strategy
If you need a custom pooling strategy, you can define it and apply it after generating the embeddings.

python
Copy
import numpy as np

def custom_pooling(embeddings):
    # Example: Mean pooling
    return np.mean(embeddings, axis=0)

def generate_embeddings(sentences):
    if sentences:
        embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)
        pooled_embeddings = custom_pooling(embeddings)
        print(f"Pooled embeddings shape: {pooled_embeddings.shape}")
        save_embeddings(pooled_embeddings, 'pooled_embeddings.npy')
Summary
Dimensionality Adjustment: Use a different model or apply dimensionality reduction techniques.

Saving Embeddings: Save generated embeddings to disk for later use.

Error Handling: Add error handling to manage unexpected issues.

Logging: Add logging for progress tracking and error reporting.

Parallel Processing: Use parallel processing to speed up file reading and processing.

Custom Pooling: Define and apply custom pooling strategies.

By incorporating these elements, you can further customize and optimize the embedding generation process to suit your specific needs.

The error you're encountering suggests that the embeddings are being moved to the CPU after generation, which might be causing issues. This could be due to memory constraints or other internal workings of the SentenceTransformer library.

To address this, let's make a few adjustments:

Reduce the Batch Size: Start with a smaller batch size to avoid memory issues.

Check GPU Memory Usage: Monitor GPU memory usage to ensure it doesn't exceed available memory.

Error Handling: Add more robust error handling to catch and manage exceptions.

Logging: Improve logging to track the progress and any errors encountered.

Here's the updated code with these adjustments:

python
Copy
import os
import json
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch
import numpy as np
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Step 1: Choose a pre-trained model
model_name = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Step 2: Load the pre-trained SentenceTransformer model
# Utilize GPUs by setting device="cuda"
model = SentenceTransformer(model_name, device="cuda")

# Step 3: Check the number of GPUs available
logging.info(f"Number of GPUs available: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")

# Step 4: Prompt the user for the directory
directory = input("Enter the directory containing text or JSON files: ")

# Step 5: Recursively process files in the directory

    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            try:
                if file.endswith(".txt"):
                    logging.info(f"Processing text file: {file_path}")
                    process_text_file(file_path)
                elif file.endswith(".json"):
                    logging.info(f"Processing JSON file: {file_path}")
                    process_json_file(file_path)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Error processing file {file_path}: {e}")

def process_text_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            text_content = file.read()
            sentences = text_content.split('\n')
            generate_embeddings(sentences)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error reading text file {file_path}: {e}")

def process_json_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            json_content = json.load(file)
            # Assuming the JSON structure is a list of sentences or a dictionary with a 'text' key
            if isinstance(json_content, list):
                sentences = json_content
            elif isinstance(json_content, dict) and 'text' in json_content:
                sentences = json_content['text'].split('\n')
            else:
                logging.warning(f"Skipping JSON file {file_path} due to unsupported format.")
                return
            generate_embeddings(sentences)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error reading JSON file {file_path}: {e}")

def generate_embeddings(sentences):
    if sentences:
        try:
            embeddings = model.encode(sentences, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)
            logging.info(f"Embeddings shape: {embeddings.shape}")
            save_embeddings(embeddings, 'embeddings.npy')

        logging.info(f"Embeddings saved to {file_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error saving embeddings to {file_path}: {e}")

# Step 6: Start processing the directory
process_directory(directory)
Key Adjustments:
Reduced Batch Size: Set batch_size=32 to avoid memory issues.

Logging: Added logging to track progress and errors.

Error Handling: Added more robust error handling to manage exceptions during file reading, embedding generation, and saving.

Monitoring GPU Memory:
To monitor GPU memory usage, you can use the following code snippet:

python
Copy
import torch

def print_gpu_memory_usage():
    print(f"GPU Memory Allocated: {torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1024 ** 2} MB")
    print(f"GPU Memory Reserved: {torch.cuda.memory_reserved() / 1024 ** 2} MB")

# Call this function periodically to monitor memory usage
print_gpu_memory_usage()
Summary:
Batch Size: Reduced to 32 to avoid memory issues.

Logging: Added logging for progress tracking and error reporting.

Error Handling: Improved error handling to manage exceptions.

GPU Memory Monitoring: Added a function to monitor GPU memory usage.

By making these adjustments, you should be able to generate embeddings more reliably and manage memory usage effectively.
