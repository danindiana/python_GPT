   - \( T_{\text{setup}} = 2 \text{ hours} \)
   - \( T_{\text{config}} = 2 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Optimize Training:**
   - Use more powerful GPUs to reduce training time.
   - \( T_{\text{train}} = 10 \times \frac{100,000}{2} = 500 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Efficient Deployment:**
   - Optimize model loading and API setup.
   - \( T_{\text{deploy}} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \text{ hour} \)

4. **Streamline Running:**

    data = response.json()
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df

def preprocess_data(df):
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')
    df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)
    df.sort_index(inplace=True)
    return df
```

    model = ARIMA(df['close'], order=(5,1,0))
    model_fit = model.fit()
    return model_fit

def train_lstm(df):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(df.shape[1], 1)))
    model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
    model.add(Dense(25))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

        if timestamp in exchange2_data.index:
            price1 = exchange1_data.loc[timestamp, 'close']
            price2 = exchange2_data.loc[timestamp, 'close']
            if abs(price1 - price2) > threshold:
                opportunities.append((timestamp, price1, price2))
    return opportunities
```

#### 4. **Execution and Deployment**
