## README.txt

**Welcome to the repository containing various projects and scripts!**

This repository contains several independent projects and scripts covering diverse topics like machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data analysis.

**Project list:**

* **Jensen-Shannon Divergence:** This project explores and implements the Jensen-Shannon divergence, a measure of similarity between probability distributions.
* **Kullback–Leibler-d:** This project implements the Kullback–Leibler divergence, another measure of similarity between probability distributions.
* **arxiv:** This script handles downloading and processing scientific papers from the arXiv repository.
* **ballistics:** This script explores using GPT for generating ballistic prompts and dialogue.
* **liquid_time_networks:** This project includes scripts for training and running Liquid Time Networks.
* **nlp_novelty:** This project focuses on measuring novelty in natural language text.
* **nlp_topic:** This project provides scripts for topic modeling in NLP tasks.
* **pdf_to_text:** This script utilizes pdfminer to extract text from PDF documents and includes a progress bar for improved user experience.
* **pdf_validator:** This script validates PDF documents for specific criteria.
* **tf_idvectorizer:** This project implements various TF-IDF vectorization techniques for text data.
* **ballisticprojectile_simulation.py:** This script simulates the trajectory of a ballistics projectile.
