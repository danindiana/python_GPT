From the output of `ip a`, your server has multiple network interfaces with the following IP addresses:

1. **`eth0`**:
   - IPv4: `192.168.1.192`

### **Accessing ComfyUI via IP**
To access the ComfyUI interface from another device on your local network, use one of the following IPv4 addresses:

- **`192.168.1.192`** (from `eth0`)
- **`192.168.1.193`** (from `eth1`)

For example, if you use `192.168.1.192`, open a web browser on another device and navigate to:
```
http://192.168.1.192:8188
```

### **Steps to Verify Connectivity**
1. **Ping the Server**:
   From another device on the same network, try pinging the server's IP address to ensure it is reachable:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.192
   ```

2. **Check Firewall Rules**:
   Ensure the firewall on your server allows incoming connections on port `8188`. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 8188/tcp
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

3. **Verify ComfyUI is Running**:
   Ensure ComfyUI is running with the `--listen` flag:
   ```bash
   python main.py --listen
   ```

   The output should indicate that the server is listening on `0.0.0.0:8188`.

### **Troubleshooting**
If you still cannot access the UI:
1. **Check Server Logs**:
   Look for any errors in the ComfyUI server logs when you start it.

2. **Test Locally**:
   On the server itself, try accessing the UI using `http://127.0.0.1:8188` to confirm the server is running correctly.

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure the device you're using to access the server is on the same network (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
   - If you're using Tailscale, ensure the device is connected to the same Tailscale network.

---

### **Summary**
- Use `http://192.168.1.192:8188` or `http://192.168.1.193:8188` to access ComfyUI from another device on your local network.
- Ensure the firewall allows traffic on port `8188` and that the server is running with `--listen`.
