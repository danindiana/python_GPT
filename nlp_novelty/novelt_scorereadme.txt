Choosing the right parameters for training a Doc2Vec model (or any machine learning model) is often a matter of experimentation and domain knowledge. However, there are some general guidelines you can follow to get started:

1. **Vector Size (`vector_size`)**: The size of the vectors is a key parameter. Larger vectors can capture more information but require more data to train effectively. If your dataset is small, you might want to start with smaller vector sizes. Common sizes include 50, 100, 200, and 300.

2. **Minimum Count (`min_count`)**: This parameter helps to ignore words with a frequency lower than the given threshold. It can help in reducing the size of the model by ignoring rare words. If your dataset has a lot of unique words that don't appear often, you might set this higher to focus on more common words.

3. **Epochs (`epochs`)**: The number of iterations over the corpus during training. Too few epochs might underfit the model, while too many might lead to overfitting, especially if the dataset is small. A common practice is to start with a lower number of epochs and increase it if the model's performance is not satisfactory.

4. **Learning Rate**: Although not shown in the function you provided, the learning rate is an important hyperparameter that controls the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Doc2Vec uses a default learning rate which decreases linearly over the epochs. You might want to experiment with the initial learning rate if you're not getting good results.

5. **Window Size**: The maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence. This is important for the algorithm to capture context. A larger window size means more context but can slow down training and increase model complexity.

To determine the best parameters for your data, consider the following steps:

- **Baseline Model**: Start with a baseline model using default or commonly used parameters.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Define a clear evaluation metric that will help you measure the performance of the model. This could be based on tasks like document similarity, classification accuracy, or any other relevant measure for your application.
- **Experimentation**: Experiment with different parameter values and compare the performance based on your evaluation metric. It's often useful to change one parameter at a time to understand its impact.
- **Validation Set**: Use a separate validation set to tune the parameters. This helps in avoiding overfitting to the training data.
- **Cross-Validation**: If you have enough data, use cross-validation to ensure that your model's performance is consistent across different subsets of your data.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Use any domain knowledge you have to guide the parameter selection. For example, if you know that the context is very important in your documents, you might opt for a larger window size.

Finally, there are automated methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization that can help in searching the hyperparameter space more efficiently. Libraries like Scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` can be used for such purposes, although they require setting up a pipeline that can evaluate the Doc2Vec model's performance on a specific task.


The `text_novelty_scorer.py` script is designed to score a collection of text files for novelty based on their content. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the script works:

1. **Class Definitions**:
   - `TextDocument`: Represents an individual text document. It stores the text, tags (usually the filename), a vector representation of the document, and a novelty score.
   - `NoveltyArchive`: Manages a collection of document vectors and provides a method to calculate the novelty score of a new document based on its distance from the vectors already in the archive.

2. **Doc2Vec Model Training**:
   - `train_doc2vec_model(tagged_data)`: This function takes tagged data (a list of `TaggedDocument` objects) and trains a `Doc2Vec` model. The `Doc2Vec` model is an unsupervised algorithm to generate vector representations for documents, which allows us to compare them semantically.

3. **Reading Text Files**:
   - `read_text_files(directory)`: This function reads all `.txt` files from the given directory, converts the content of each file into a list of words, and wraps it into a `TaggedDocument` object with tags (usually the filename).

4. **User Input**:
   - The script starts by asking the user to input the path to the directory containing the text files to be scored.

5. **Processing Text Files**:
   - The script reads the text files from the provided directory and prepares them for processing.
   - It then trains a `Doc2Vec` model on the prepared data to learn vector representations of the documents.

6. **Scoring for Novelty**:
   - Each document is converted into a vector using the trained `Doc2Vec` model.
   - The `NoveltyArchive` object is used to calculate the novelty score for each document. The novelty score is based on the average cosine distance from the document's vector to its k-nearest neighbors' vectors in the archive.
   - After scoring, each document's vector is added to the archive to be considered as a neighbor for subsequent documents.

7. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The documents are sorted in descending order based on their novelty scores.
   - The script prints out the filename and novelty score for each document.

The script uses the cosine distance to measure novelty, which is a common approach in NLP for comparing the similarity of documents. By considering the nearest neighbors in the vector space, the script assigns higher novelty scores to documents that are less similar to the ones already seen, thus capturing the essence of "novelty" as described in the referenced paper.

The `text_novelty_scorer.py` script is a high-level implementation and may require further refinement or adjustment depending on the specific dataset and the desired granularity of the novelty scoring. It assumes that the text files are preprocessed (e.g., tokenized) if necessary, and that the `Doc2Vec` model parameters are suitable for the dataset at hand.
