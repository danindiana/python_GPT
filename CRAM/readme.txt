Conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing demands
from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence, because much of
the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers between logic and memory
modules. A new paradigm, called “computational random-access memory (CRAM)” has
emerged to address this fundamental limitation. CRAM performs logic operations
directly using the memory cells themselves, without having the data ever leave the
memory. The energy and performance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and
emerging applications have been well established by prior numerical studies. However,
there lacks an experimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its
computation accuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metrics for its
technological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based on
magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory
operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are studied. Then, a 1-bit full
adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a
suite of modeling has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM
computation. Further analysis of scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix
multiplication shows promising results. These results are then applied to a complete
application: a neural network based handwritten digit classifier, as an example to show
the connection between the application performance and further MTJ development. The
classifier achieved almost-perfect classification accuracy, with reasonable projections of
future MTJ development. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM’s accuracy,
there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant impact on power- and
energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence. Generate a toy model which demonstrates this application in python.

Creating a toy model to demonstrate the concept of Computational Random-Access Memory (CRAM) and its application in Python would be quite complex and beyond the scope of a simple code example. However, I can provide you with a simplified, conceptual code snippet that illustrates a basic idea of how CRAM-like operations could be applied in a neural network context. Keep in mind that this is a highly simplified representation and doesn't cover all the intricacies of CRAM technology.

In this example, we'll create a simple neural network using NumPy and simulate a basic CRAM-like operation for a forward pass in the network:

In this simplified example:

We define a "memory array" that represents the CRAM-like memory, containing some initial values.
We define "input data" as the data to be processed by the CRAM-like memory.
We perform a CRAM-like computation, which involves element-wise multiplication of the memory array and the input data.
Finally, we sum the results of the element-wise multiplication to produce the final output.
Please note that this code simplifies the CRAM concept significantly and doesn't accurately represent the complexities and capabilities of real CRAM technology. Real CRAM systems involve complex analog and digital components for efficient in-memory computation, which goes far beyond this simplified illustration. Nonetheless, this code provides a basic conceptual example of how CRAM-like operations could be applied within a neural network context.
