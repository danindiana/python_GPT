The webpage you provided, titled "How to Build Multimodal Retrieval with ColQwen and Vespa?" on Analytics Vidhya, offers a comprehensive guide on building a multimodal retrieval system using ColQwen and Vespa. Here’s a summary of the key points covered in the article:

### **1. Introduction to ColQwen and Vespa**
- **ColQwen**: An advanced multimodal retrieval model from the ColPali family, designed to process entire document pages as images using Vision Language Models (VLMs). It captures both text and visual structure, making it ideal for visually dense documents like financial reports or research papers[citation:1][citation:2].
- **Vespa**: An open-source vector database and search platform that supports multi-vector representations, enabling efficient retrieval, custom ranking, and indexing strategies[citation:1][citation:2].

### **2. Challenges in Traditional Document Retrieval**
- Traditional systems rely on OCR, layout detection, and text embedding, which often lose critical visual context. ColQwen bypasses these steps by directly embedding the entire page image, preserving both text and visual cues[citation:1][citation:2].

### **3. Key Features of ColQwen**
- **Multi-vector Embeddings**: Instead of single-vector embeddings, ColQwen creates multiple embeddings for each query token, allowing for detailed interaction with specific parts of the document (e.g., tables, headings, figures)[citation:1][citation:2].
- **Patches**: Images are divided into small sections (patches), each with its own embedding, enabling focused analysis of complex pages[citation:1][citation:2].
- **Dynamic Resolution**: ColQwen2 supports images in their native resolutions, preserving aspect ratios and allowing users to adjust resolution for performance and storage trade-offs[citation:1][citation:2].

### **4. Building the Retrieval System**
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: The article provides a detailed tutorial on setting up the system, including:
  - Installing necessary libraries (e.g., `transformers`, `colpali-engine`, `pdf2image`, `pyvespa`)[citation:1][citation:2].
  - Converting PDF pages into images using `pdf2image`[citation:1][citation:2].
  - Generating multi-vector embeddings for each page using ColQwen[citation:1][citation:2].
  - Storing embeddings and metadata in Vespa using binary quantization and base64 encoding for images[citation:1][citation:2].
- **Binary Quantization**: Embeddings are binarized to reduce storage size by 32x, enabling efficient Hamming distance calculations for similarity search[citation:1][citation:2].

### **5. Vespa Schema and Retrieval Pipeline**
- The article defines a Vespa schema to store document metadata, embeddings, and images. It also sets up a two-phase retrieval pipeline:
  - **Phase 1**: Uses Hamming distance for fast filtering.
  - **Phase 2**: Applies MaxSim for precise re-ranking[citation:1][citation:2].

### **6. Practical Use Cases**
- The guide demonstrates the system using financial PDFs, showcasing its ability to handle complex structures like tables and charts[citation:1][citation:2].

### **7. Colab Notebook**
- A Colab notebook (`ColQwen_pdf_retrieval_and_interpretability.ipynb`) is provided for hands-on practice, allowing users to experiment with the system on both free and pro versions of Google Colab[citation:1][citation:2].

### **Conclusion**
The article highlights the groundbreaking shift from traditional text-based retrieval to multimodal retrieval with ColQwen and Vespa, offering a robust solution for handling visually rich documents. It emphasizes the simplicity and efficiency of the system, making it accessible for developers and researchers[citation:1][citation:2].

The article "Hands-On Multimodal Retrieval and Interpretability (ColQwen + Vespa)" from Analytics Vidhya provides a comprehensive guide on building a document retrieval system that leverages both visual and textual information. 

Traditional document retrieval systems often rely heavily on text extraction, losing critical context provided by visuals like the layout of tables or balance sheets. ColQwen, an advanced multimodal retrieval model in the ColPali family, addresses this limitation by embedding entire document pages as images, preserving their full visual structure—including tables, images, and headings. 

The guide outlines the following key steps:

1. **Understanding ColQwen and Multivector Embeddings**: ColQwen uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) approach to process entire document pages as images, creating multi-vector embeddings that capture both text and visual cues. 

2. **Preparing Financial PDFs for Retrieval**: Converting PDF pages into images to facilitate embedding with ColQwen's VLM. 

3. **Embedding Pages with ColQwen’s VLM**: Generating multi-vector embeddings for each page image, preserving both text and visual context. 

4. **Configuring Vespa for Efficient Search**: Setting up Vespa, an open-source vector database and search platform, with an optimized schema and ranking profile to handle dense and sparse data. 

5. **Building a Two-Phase Retrieval Pipeline**: Implementing a retrieval pipeline using Vespa’s Hamming distance and MaxSim calculations to enhance search efficiency. 

6. **Visualizing Retrieved Pages and Interpretability**: Exploring ColQwen’s explainability features to interpret and visualize relevant patches in retrieved documents. 

By following this guide, developers can create a robust document retrieval system that maintains the rich context within complex documents, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of search results.
