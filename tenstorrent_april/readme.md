Here's a breakdown of the PyBuda installation pre-flight check script:

### Purpose:
This bash script checks system prerequisites and configuration before attempting to install PyBuda (Tenstorrent's machine learning framework).

### Key Components:

1. **Configuration Variables**:
   - Sets expected Python version (3.10)
   - Defines expected source directories for PyBuda (tt-buda), KMD (kernel mode driver), and system tools
   - Specifies required KMD version (1.33 in this example)

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - `check_command`: Verifies if a command exists and optionally checks its version
   - `check_package`: Checks if a debian package is installed
   - `check_dir`: Verifies if a directory exists

3. **Check Categories**:

   - **OS Check**: Verifies Ubuntu 22.04 is running
   - **Sudo Check**: Tests sudo access (required for installation)
   - **Tools Check**: Verifies essential tools (Python, git, g++, cmake, dkms, make)
   - **Packages Check**: Checks for required packages (build-essential, Python venv, libgtest-dev)
   - **Source Directories**: Verifies expected source directories exist
   - **HugePages**: Checks HugePages configuration (important for performance)
   - **KMD Check**: Verifies kernel driver version matches requirements

4. **Output**:
   - Provides clear [PASS]/[FAIL]/[WARN] status for each check
   - Summarizes total failures at the end
   - Returns exit code equal to number of failed checks

### Usage:
Run this script before attempting PyBuda installation to identify potential issues. Address any [FAIL] items before proceeding with installation.

### Notes:
- The script is designed for Ubuntu 22.04 systems
- Configuration variables should be adjusted to match your specific PyBuda version requirements
- Some checks may produce warnings ([WARN]) that don't necessarily block installation but indicate potential issues

The script provides a comprehensive pre-installation check to help avoid common installation problems.
