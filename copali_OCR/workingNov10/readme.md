In this code, `max_chunk_size` and `max_sequence_length` are used to manage memory and processing limits when handling large text data, ensuring the program doesn’t exceed the model's or hardware's capacities. Here’s how each of them works:

### `max_chunk_size`

- **Purpose**: Controls the size of text chunks to be processed by the model in each batch.
- **Function**: Splits the extracted text (from the PDF) into smaller, more manageable chunks based on word count, with each chunk containing up to `max_chunk_size` words.
- **Why It’s Useful**: 
  - By processing the text in smaller pieces, we avoid memory issues that can occur if we try to process a very large block of text at once.
  - This is especially useful when working with long documents, as it helps distribute memory usage and processing load evenly, reducing the risk of out-of-memory errors on the GPU.

### `max_sequence_length`

- **Purpose**: Defines the maximum length (in words or tokens) that each chunk can have when processed by the model.
- **Function**: If any text chunk (after splitting) has a length exceeding `max_sequence_length`, it will be skipped and recorded in `skipped_files`.
- **Why It’s Useful**:
  - The model has a limit on the maximum number of tokens it can process in one go. `max_sequence_length` prevents exceeding this limit, which could otherwise cause errors or degrade performance.
  - Skipping overly long chunks avoids overwhelming the model and helps conserve memory, as processing a very long chunk could lead to CUDA memory errors on the GPU.

### Workflow in the Code

1. **Splitting the Text**: After the PDF text is extracted, it’s split into chunks, each up to `max_chunk_size` words. These chunks make it easier to handle large documents without running into memory issues.
2. **Checking Each Chunk**: Each chunk’s length is checked against `max_sequence_length`:
   - If a chunk is within the limit, it’s processed as normal.
   - If a chunk exceeds `max_sequence_length`, the program skips the file, adding it to `skipped_files` and printing a message, as this chunk is too large for the model to process efficiently.

Together, `max_chunk_size` and `max_sequence_length` help optimize memory usage, prevent errors, and allow the code to handle larger PDFs by processing manageable chunks.

This code has several nuanced behaviors and considerations that help it process PDF files effectively, especially when handling large documents with a mix of text and images. Here’s an overview of some additional aspects to consider:

### 1. **PDF Text and Image Extraction Logic**
   - **Direct Text Extraction**: The `extract_text_without_ocr` function first attempts to extract any embedded text from the PDF directly using `PyMuPDF`. This is typically faster and more accurate than OCR for PDFs with embedded selectable text.
   - **OCR Processing**: If direct text extraction yields no text, the code falls back on OCR to extract text from images within the PDF. OCR (using `pytesseract`) converts the images of text into actual text, which is crucial for scanned PDFs or those that lack embedded text.
   - **Image Processing**: The code also extracts images from the PDF, applies preprocessing (grayscale, autocontrast, binary thresholding), and scales them down to manage memory usage. These images are then fed to a model for further processing, with each image handled in small batches to avoid GPU memory overload.

### 2. **Device Management and CUDA Memory Optimization**
   - **GPU Memory Management**: The code uses `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` to clear unused GPU memory after processing each batch, which helps prevent CUDA memory errors, especially when processing large images.
   - **Dynamic Memory Configuration**: Setting `os.environ["PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF"] = "expandable_segments:True"` enables PyTorch to manage memory more flexibly, allowing memory usage to expand dynamically, which can reduce the risk of out-of-memory errors during processing.

### 3. **Recursive File Processing**
   - Based on user input, the code can either process files in the specified directory only or include all subdirectories. This is managed through a user prompt, and the code then uses either `os.walk` for recursive search or `os.listdir` for a single directory.

### 4. **Model and Processor Loading**
   - **On-Demand Loading**: The model (`ColQwen2`) and its processor are loaded only after verifying the existence of input and output directories. This ensures that the model loads and reserves GPU resources only if necessary, preventing premature allocation of GPU memory.
   - **Half-Precision Loading**: The model is loaded with `torch_dtype=torch.float16`, which helps reduce memory usage by using half-precision floating-point numbers. This is beneficial for large models and can lower the likelihood of memory-related errors.

### 5. **Handling Skipped Files**
   - **Tracking Skipped Files**: Files are skipped and recorded if any text chunk exceeds `max_sequence_length`, or if a CUDA memory error occurs during processing. These files are added to `skipped_files` and reported to the user at the end, allowing them to identify which files require alternative handling or adjustments.
   - **Error Handling**: Errors encountered while loading a PDF or during model processing are caught and handled gracefully, ensuring that the program continues running even if specific files fail to process.

### 6. **Similarity Scoring**
   - **Text and Image Similarity Scoring**: The code calculates similarity scores between text and image embeddings to identify relationships within the content. These scores could be used to determine how closely related extracted text and images are, which could be useful for tasks like document summarization or content clustering.
   - **Aggregation of Scores**: The similarity scores for each file are averaged to provide a single similarity metric, which helps quantify the relatedness of content in each document, providing a useful summary statistic.

### 7. **Model Constraints and Chunking Strategy**
   - **Text Splitting Logic**: The `split_text_into_chunks` function splits text based on `max_chunk_size` to ensure that each text segment remains manageable. This chunking approach is crucial for efficient processing of large text blocks and helps to avoid exceeding the model’s sequence length capabilities.
   - **Skipping Large Chunks**: Any chunk that exceeds `max_sequence_length` is not processed to avoid errors, which is an efficient safeguard against running into model limitations.

### 8. **User Interaction and Directory Management**
   - The program is user-driven, requiring directory paths and processing options as inputs. This interactivity gives the user control over where the input files are located and where the outputs will be stored, providing flexibility and adaptability based on user needs.

### 9. **Output Files and Results Storage**
   - **Text Storage**: For each PDF processed, the OCR or directly extracted text is saved as a `.txt` file in the specified output directory. This gives a clear output for further analysis or review.
   - **Embeddings**: If embeddings are successfully created from the images, they are stored and can be used for downstream tasks (though they aren’t saved to disk here). This approach could be extended to save embeddings if needed.

### Summary of Potential Considerations

This code is robust for handling a variety of PDFs, but it’s important to be aware of some limitations:
   - **GPU Memory Constraints**: Processing large PDFs or many high-resolution images can still exceed available memory, even with the optimizations.
   - **Skipped Files Due to Sequence Length**: PDFs with very dense or extensive text may get skipped, depending on the chosen `max_sequence_length`.
   - **Output Storage Strategy**: Extending the code to save embeddings or additional metadata might be useful if further analysis is required.

In essence, the code leverages efficient memory handling, modular processing (text and image extraction), and model constraints to handle PDF processing with flexibility, adapting based on user input and system capacity.

In this program, embeddings are generated for images extracted from the PDF and are processed in batches to avoid out-of-memory issues. Here's a detailed explanation of how the program handles embeddings:

### 1. **Image Embedding Extraction**

The program processes images extracted from each PDF file using the following steps:

   - **Image Preprocessing**: Each image extracted from the PDF is preprocessed for OCR and prepared for embedding extraction by resizing and converting it to grayscale with additional contrast and threshold adjustments.
   
   - **Batch Processing**: 
     - To manage memory efficiently, images are processed in batches with a batch size of 1 (or more if memory allows). This minimizes the risk of out-of-memory errors on the GPU, as each image is processed individually rather than all at once.
     - The batch is then processed by `processor.process_images(image_batch)`, which prepares the images in a format that can be fed into the model.

   - **Embedding Generation**:
     - The images are passed to the model (`ColQwen2`), which generates embeddings for each image batch. 
     - These embeddings are tensors representing the features or "essence" of the image as understood by the model.
     - The embeddings for each image batch are stored in `all_image_embeddings`, a list that accumulates embeddings for all images in the PDF.

### 2. **Managing GPU Memory**

   - **Memory Cleanup**: After each batch of images is processed, `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is called to free up any unused GPU memory. This is important to prevent memory fragmentation and to maximize the available memory for subsequent batches.

   - **Concatenating Embeddings**: Once all images have been processed, the individual image embeddings are concatenated into a single tensor with `torch.cat(all_image_embeddings, dim=0)`. This gives a unified tensor representing all the image embeddings for the document, ready for downstream tasks.

### 3. **Similarity Scoring with Text Embeddings**

   - If the document contains text, the program also processes text chunks into embeddings and calculates similarity scores between the text and image embeddings:
     - **Text Processing**: Each chunk of text is processed by `processor.process_queries(queries)`, creating embeddings that capture the features of the text.
     - **Score Calculation**: The `processor.score_multi_vector(query_embeddings, all_image_embeddings)` function calculates a similarity score between each text embedding and each image embedding. This similarity score gives insight into how closely related the text and images are, which could be useful for further analysis like text-image alignment or clustering.
   - The similarity scores are averaged for each PDF file, providing a single similarity metric, which is printed for review.

### 4. **Saving and Accessing Embeddings**

While the current code does not directly save embeddings to disk, here’s how you could modify it to save them:

   - **Saving Embeddings**: Add code to save `all_image_embeddings` to a file after processing each PDF file. For example:
     ```python
     torch.save(all_image_embeddings, os.path.join(output_dir, f"{pdf_file}_image_embeddings.pt"))
     ```
     This would save the embeddings as a `.pt` file in the output directory, where `torch.load` could later retrieve it.

   - **Use Cases for Saved Embeddings**:
     - **Retrieval or Analysis**: Saved embeddings could be used in later stages of a project, such as comparing images across PDFs, clustering similar documents, or aligning text and images.
     - **Fine-Tuning and Transfer Learning**: The embeddings could serve as inputs for other models in cases where additional downstream tasks require labeled image-text pairs or other machine learning tasks.

In summary, the program processes embeddings efficiently in batches, calculates similarity scores for text-image alignment, and manages GPU memory to avoid out-of-memory issues. With minor modifications, it could save embeddings for long-term storage and reuse.
