Great job on the refactoring! The modular structure will make the code more maintainable and easier to debug. Here are a few additional suggestions and checks to ensure everything works smoothly:

### 1. **Testing Each Module Independently**

Before integrating everything into the main script, test each module to ensure it works as expected. Here are some quick tests you can run:

#### `preprocessing.py`
```python
from PIL import Image
from preprocessing import preprocess_image_for_ocr, split_text_into_chunks

# Test preprocess_image_for_ocr
image = Image.open("test_image.jpg")
processed_image = preprocess_image_for_ocr(image)
processed_image.show()  # Check if the image looks correctly processed

# Test split_text_into_chunks
text = "This is a test text to split into chunks."
chunks = split_text_into_chunks(text, 5)
print(chunks)  # Should print ['This is a test text', 'to split into chunks.']
```

#### `pdf_ocr_utils.py`
```python
from pdf_ocr_utils import extract_images_and_text_ocr

# Test extract_images_and_text_ocr
pdf_path = "test_pdf.pdf"
images, pdf_text, ocr_text = extract_images_and_text_ocr(pdf_path)
print("PDF Text:", pdf_text)
print("OCR Text:", ocr_text)
for img in images:
    img.show()  # Check if images are correctly extracted
```

#### `gpu_selection.py`
```python
from gpu_selection import get_gpu_info, select_gpu

# Test get_gpu_info
gpus = get_gpu_info()
print(gpus)  # Should print a list of GPUs with their details

# Test select_gpu
selected_gpu = select_gpu(gpus)
print("Selected GPU:", selected_gpu)
```

#### `model_utils.py`
```python
import torch
from model_utils import load_model_and_processor

# Test load_model_and_processor
device = torch.device("cuda:0")
model, processor = load_model_and_processor(device)
print("Model loaded:", model)
print("Processor loaded:", processor)
```

#### `progress_tracker.py`
```python
from progress_tracker import load_progress, save_progress

# Test load_progress
processed_files = load_progress()
print("Loaded progress:", processed_files)

# Test save_progress
save_progress({"file1.pdf", "file2.pdf"})
print("Progress saved.")
```

#### `error_logger.py`
```python
from error_logger import log_error

# Test log_error
log_error("test_file.pdf", "This is a test error message.")
print("Error logged.")
```

#### `pymupdf_utils.py`
```python
from utils.pymupdf_utils import extract_text_without_ocr

# Test extract_text_without_ocr
pdf_path = "test_pdf.pdf"
text = extract_text_without_ocr(pdf_path)
print("Extracted text:", text)
```

### 2. **Integrating Modules in `main_script.py`**

Ensure that the main script correctly imports and uses each module. Hereâ€™s a quick check:

```python
import os
import torch
import gc
from preprocessing import preprocess_image_for_ocr, split_text_into_chunks
from pdf_ocr_utils import extract_images_and_text_ocr
from gpu_selection import get_gpu_info, select_gpu
from model_utils import load_model_and_processor
from progress_tracker import load_progress, save_progress
from error_logger import log_error

# Rest of the main_script.py code...
```

### 3. **Refactor and Optimize**

- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling throughout the code, especially in the main script where multiple operations are chained together.
- **Memory Management**: Continuously monitor GPU memory usage and ensure that `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` and `gc.collect()` are used effectively to prevent out-of-memory errors.
- **Logging**: Enhance logging to provide more detailed information about the processing steps, especially for debugging purposes.
- **Performance**: Profile the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize them. For example, reducing the batch size or optimizing image processing steps can help manage memory better.

### 4. **Final Checks**

- **Run the Entire Pipeline**: Execute the main script with a sample set of PDF files to ensure everything works end-to-end.
- **Review Outputs**: Check the output files and logs to ensure the results are as expected.
- **Edge Cases**: Test with edge cases such as very large files, files with no text, and files with complex layouts to ensure robustness.

By following these steps, you should have a well-tested and modular codebase that is ready for further development or deployment. If you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
