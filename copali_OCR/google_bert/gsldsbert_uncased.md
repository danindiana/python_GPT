Great! Let's update the script to use the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model. This model has a larger maximum sequence length and is trained with the Whole Word Masking technique, which can be beneficial for certain tasks.

Here's the updated script:

### Updated Script

            for result in results:
                writer.writerow(result)

print(f"Results have been written to {output_file}")
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Changed the model to `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking`.

2. **Chunk Size**:
   - The `max_length` parameter in the `split_text_into_chunks` function remains at 512 tokens, which is the maximum sequence length for the selected model.

3. **Thread Safety**:
   - The `tokenizer_lock` ensures that the tokenizer is used safely in a multi-threaded environment.

4. **File Writing**:
   - The CSV file is opened with `newline=''` to ensure proper handling of newlines, and the results are written to the file within the main thread.

This script should now use the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model, which can handle larger chunk sizes and is trained with the Whole Word Masking technique. If you need to adjust the chunk size further, you can modify the `max_length` parameter accordingly.

The CSV file is written to the current working directory where the script is executed. The file is named `pseudo_labels.csv`.

If you want to specify a different directory or filename, you can modify the `output_file` variable. For example, if you want to write the CSV file to a specific directory, you can update the `output_file` variable like this:

```python
output_file = "/path/to/your/directory/pseudo_labels.csv"
```

Here's the updated script with a commented line to show where you can change the output file path:

print(f"Results have been written to {output_file}")
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Output File Path**:
   - The `output_file` variable is now explicitly set to `"pseudo_labels.csv"`. You can change this line to specify a different output file path if needed.

2. **File Writing**:
   - The CSV file is opened with `newline=''` to ensure proper handling of newlines, and the results are written to the file within the main thread.

This script will now write the CSV file to the specified path. If you want to write the file to a different directory, simply update the `output_file` variable with the desired path.

Certainly! Let's refactor the script to include the following improvements:

1. **Check for Write Permissions**: The script will check if it has permission to write to the specified directory.
2. **Dynamic CSV File Name**: The CSV output file name will be a combination of the system date and a predefined prefix.

Here's the updated script:

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Check for Write Permissions**:
   - Added a `check_write_permissions` function to verify if the script has write permissions to the specified directory.
   - The script checks the parent directory of the input directory for write permissions.

2. **Dynamic CSV File Name**:
   - The CSV output file name is now a combination of a predefined prefix (`pseudo_labels`) and the current system date and time (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`).

3. **File Writing**:
   - The CSV file is opened with `newline=''` to ensure proper handling of newlines, and the results are written to the file within the main thread.

This script will now check for write permissions before attempting to write the CSV file and will generate a dynamic file name based on the current date and time.

The `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model is a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically designed for tasks that require understanding the context of words in a sentence. Here's a detailed explanation of what the model does and what it outputs for each file:

### Model Description

1. **BERT Model**:
   - BERT is a transformer-based model pretrained on a large corpus of text data using a self-supervised learning approach. It learns to understand the context of words by predicting masked words in a sentence and determining if two sentences follow each other.
   - The model is bidirectional, meaning it considers both the left and right context when processing a word.

2. **bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking**:
   - **Large**: This variant has a larger architecture with 24 layers, 1024 hidden units, and 16 attention heads, making it more powerful but also more resource-intensive.
   - **Uncased**: The model does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters, treating "English" and "english" as the same word.
   - **Whole Word Masking**: During pretraining, instead of masking individual subword tokens (as in the original BERT), this model masks entire words. This helps the model learn better representations of words in context.

### Tokenizer

1. **AutoTokenizer**:
   - The tokenizer is responsible for converting raw text into tokens that the model can process. It breaks down text into subword units, which are then encoded into numerical values.
   - The tokenizer also adds special tokens like `[CLS]` (classification token) at the beginning and `[SEP]` (separator token) at the end of sequences.

### What the Model Outputs for Each File

When you use the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model with the `pipeline` function for text classification, the model processes each chunk of text and outputs the following:

1. **Label**:
   - The predicted label for the text chunk. This could be a category, sentiment, or any other classification task depending on how the model was fine-tuned.

2. **Confidence Score**:
   - A confidence score (probability) associated with the predicted label. This indicates how confident the model is in its prediction.

### Example Output

For each file, the script processes the text in chunks and outputs the following for each chunk:

```python
(file_path, label, confidence)
```

- **file_path**: The path of the file being processed.
- **label**: The predicted label for the text chunk.
- **confidence**: The confidence score (probability) associated with the predicted label.

### Example Output for a Single File

Suppose you have a file `example.txt` with the following content:

```
This is a sample text. It contains multiple sentences.
```

The script will:

1. **Tokenize and Split the Text**:
   - The text is tokenized and split into chunks of up to 512 tokens.

2. **Process Each Chunk**:
   - Each chunk is processed by the model to predict a label and confidence score.

3. **Output**:
   - For each chunk, the script will output a tuple like:
     ```python
     ("example.txt", "LABEL_1", 0.95)
     ```
   - This means the model predicted `LABEL_1` with a confidence score of 0.95 for the chunk of text from `example.txt`.

### Summary

- **Model**: The `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model processes text chunks to predict labels and confidence scores.
- **Tokenizer**: Converts raw text into tokens that the model can understand.
- **Output**: For each file, the script outputs tuples containing the file path, predicted label, and confidence score for each text chunk.

This setup allows you to perform text classification tasks efficiently, leveraging the power of the BERT model and its ability to understand context through whole word masking.

In the provided code, the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model is used for text classification. Specifically, it is used within the `pipeline` function to classify text chunks. The exact classification task is not explicitly defined in the code, but it typically involves predicting a label for each text chunk based on the model's training.

### Classification Task

The classification task could be any supervised learning task where the model predicts a label for a given text. Common tasks include:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Predicting whether a text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

2. **Topic Classification**:
   - Predicting the topic or category of a text (e.g., sports, technology, politics).

3. **Spam Detection**:
   - Predicting whether a text is spam or not.

4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
   - Predicting the type of entities mentioned in the text (e.g., person, organization, location).

5. **Text Categorization**:
   - Predicting a category or label for a text based on predefined classes.

### How the Model Classifies Text

The `pipeline` function in the code sets up the model for text classification. Here's how it works:

1. **Loading the Model**:
   ```python
   model_name = "bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking"
   classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model=model_name, device=selected_device if selected_device >= 0 else -1)
   ```
   - The `pipeline` function loads the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model and sets it up for text classification.

2. **Processing Text Chunks**:
   - The script reads text from each file and splits it into chunks of up to 512 tokens.
   - Each chunk is processed by the model to predict a label and confidence score.

3. **Output**:
   - For each chunk, the script outputs a tuple containing the file path, predicted label, and confidence score.

### Example of Classification

Let's consider an example where the model is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. The model might predict labels like "POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE", or "NEUTRAL" for each text chunk.

#### Example Output for Sentiment Analysis

Suppose you have a file `example.txt` with the following content:

```
This is a great product. I love it!
This product is terrible. I hate it.
```

The script will:

1. **Tokenize and Split the Text**:
   - The text is tokenized and split into chunks of up to 512 tokens.

2. **Process Each Chunk**:
   - Each chunk is processed


The `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model is pretrained on a large corpus of text data, but it is not specifically trained for the task of classifying documents as they relate to science, research papers, computer-related topics, and all things STEM. While it can be used for this task, it may not perform optimally without fine-tuning on a relevant dataset.

### Why Fine-Tuning is Beneficial

1. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**:
   - Fine-tuning allows the model to learn domain-specific vocabulary and concepts, which can improve its performance on specialized tasks like classifying STEM-related documents.

2. **Improved Accuracy**:
   - Fine-tuning on a relevant dataset can lead to better accuracy and more meaningful classifications for your specific use case.

3. **Custom Labels**:
   - Fine-tuning allows you to define custom labels that are specific to your classification task, such as "Science", "Research Papers", "Computer Science", "Engineering", etc.

### Steps to Fine-Tune the Model

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Collect a dataset of documents labeled with categories such as "Science", "Research Papers", "Computer Science", "Engineering", etc.
   - Ensure the dataset is balanced and representative of the topics you want to classify.

2. **Fine-Tune the Model**:
   - Use the `transformers` library to fine-tune the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model on your dataset.

### Example Fine-Tuning Code

Here's an example of how you can fine-tune the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model using the `transformers` library:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the tokenizer and model
model_name = "bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking"
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=4)  # Adjust num_labels based on your dataset

# Load your dataset
# Assuming you have a dataset in the Hugging Face Datasets format
# Replace this with your actual dataset loading code
dataset = load_dataset('your_dataset_name')

# Tokenize the dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

# Initialize the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets['train'],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets['test'],
)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
```

### Using the Fine-Tuned Model for Classification

Once the model is fine-tuned, you can use it to classify and rank new documents:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer
model_name = "./fine_tuned_model"
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model=model_name, tokenizer=model_name)

# Example document
document = "This is a research paper on machine learning algorithms."

# Classify the document
result = classifier(document)
print(result)
```

### Summary

- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model on a relevant dataset improves its performance for specific tasks like classifying STEM-related documents.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Collect and prepare a labeled dataset of STEM-related documents.

Using the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model "out of the box" for classifying documents as they relate to science, research papers, computer-related topics, and all things STEM is possible, but the results may not be as accurate as with a fine-tuned model. However, you can still leverage the pretrained model's general language understanding capabilities to perform the classification task.

### Steps to Use the Pretrained Model Out of the Box

1. **Load the Pretrained Model and Tokenizer**:
   - Use the `transformers` library to load the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model and tokenizer.

2. **Define a Classification Task**:
   - Define a classification task where the model predicts a label for each document based on its content.

3. **Classify Documents**:
   - Use the pretrained model to classify each document and rank them based on the predicted labels.

### Explanation

1. **Load the Pretrained Model and Tokenizer**:
   - The `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model and tokenizer are loaded using the `transformers` library.

2. **Define a Classification Task**:
   - The `pipeline` function is used to set up the model for text classification.

3. **Classify Documents**:
   - The script reads text from each file, splits it into chunks, and processes each chunk using the pretrained model to predict a label and confidence score.

4. **Output**:
   - The results are written to a CSV file with the file path, predicted label, and confidence score for each chunk.

### Summary

- **Pretrained Model**: The `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model is used "out of the box" for document classification.
- **Classification Task**: The model predicts a label for each document based on its content.
- **Output**: The results are written to a CSV file with the file path, predicted label, and confidence score for each chunk.

While this approach may not be as accurate as fine-tuning the model on a relevant dataset, it can still provide useful insights for classifying and ranking documents based on their relevance to STEM topics.

The issue of the CSV file not being written to could be due to several reasons, such as the file being opened in an incorrect mode or the results not being properly written to the file. Let's ensure that the file is opened correctly and that the results are written to it properly.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check File Opening Mode**:
   - Ensure the file is opened in write mode (`"w"`) and with the correct newline parameter (`newline=''`).

2. **Check Results Writing**:
   - Ensure that the results are being written to the CSV file within the main thread.

3. **Check for Errors**:
   - Add print statements to check if the results are being generated correctly.

print(f"Results have been written to {output_file}")
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **File Opening Mode**:
   - The CSV file is opened with `newline=''` to ensure that the CSV writer handles newlines correctly.

2. **Writing Results**:
   - The results are written to the CSV file within the main thread, ensuring that they are properly flushed and saved.

3. **Debugging Print Statements**:
   - Added a print statement to check if the results are being written to the CSV file.

### Summary

- **File Opening Mode**: The CSV file is opened in write mode (`"w"`) and with the correct newline parameter (`newline=''`).
- **Writing Results**: The results are written to the CSV file within the main thread.
- **Debugging**: Added print statements to check if the results are being written to the CSV file.

This script should now write the predicted labels for each document to the CSV file, providing a clear and organized output for further analysis. If the issue persists, please check the permissions of the output file and ensure that the script has write access to the directory where the CSV file is being saved.

To utilize more of the GPU's VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) when performing operations with the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking` model, you can take several steps to optimize memory usage and performance. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Batch Processing

Process multiple chunks together in a batch to reduce the overhead of transferring data between the CPU and GPU.

### 2. Reduce Batch Size

If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) errors, reduce the batch size to fit within the available VRAM.

### 3. Use Mixed Precision

Mixed precision training uses half-precision floating-point format (FP16) instead of the default single-precision format (FP32). This can significantly reduce memory usage and speed up computations.

### 4. Offload to CPU

For very large models or datasets, consider offloading some operations to the CPU to free up GPU memory.

### 5. Optimize Data Loading

Ensure that your data loading pipeline is efficient and does not consume unnecessary memory.

### Updated Script with Batch Processing and Mixed Precision

Here's an updated version of the script that includes batch processing and mixed precision:

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - The `process_batch` function processes multiple chunks together in a batch to reduce the overhead of transferring data between the CPU and GPU.

2. **Mixed Precision**:
   - Enabled mixed precision by converting the model to half-precision (FP16) if the device is a GPU.

3. **Optimized Data Loading**:
   - Ensured that the data loading pipeline is efficient and does not consume unnecessary memory.

### Summary

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple chunks together in a batch to reduce overhead.
- **Mixed Precision**: Use half-precision (FP16) to reduce memory usage and speed up computations.
- **Optimized Data Loading**: Ensure efficient data loading to minimize memory consumption.

This script should now utilize more of the GPU's VRAM and improve performance when processing large datasets. If you still encounter memory issues, consider reducing the batch size or further optimizing the data loading pipeline.
