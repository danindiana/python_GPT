The difference in perceived performance between JSON and text (`txt`) output could stem from several factors related to file writing and text processing. Here's a breakdown of why JSON output might seem faster:

---

### 1. **Line-by-Line Writing vs. Single Operation**  
   - **Text Files (`txt`)**:
     - When writing to a text file, the script may write each line individually (depending on your implementation), especially if you're processing and formatting lines in a loop. Each file operation introduces slight overhead.
   - **JSON Files**:
     - JSON output is typically written in a single operation after serializing the entire data structure into a JSON string. This reduces the number of file operations compared to line-by-line writes for a text file.

---

### 2. **Buffering Differences**  
   - File I/O libraries often have different buffering strategies for text versus binary/JSON writing. Writing structured JSON data may leverage efficient buffering mechanisms, while line-by-line text writing may flush the buffer more frequently, leading to slower performance.

---

### 3. **Text Manipulation Overhead**  
   - **Text Files (`txt`)**:
     - If your script is formatting the text (e.g., appending newlines, adding headers, or processing each line), this introduces computational overhead.
     - For example, converting the combined text into a line-by-line structure or applying additional formatting might slow down the process.
   - **JSON Files**:
     - JSON serialization with `json.dump()` avoids line-by-line manipulation and directly serializes the data into the desired format, skipping intermediate steps.

---

### 4. **Encoding Complexity**  
   - **Text Files (`txt`)**:
     - If the text contains special characters or requires encoding transformations (e.g., UTF-8, Unicode normalization), this can slow down the process.
   - **JSON Files**:
     - JSON inherently handles Unicode text efficiently, often requiring fewer transformations if the data is already in a compatible encoding.

---

### 5. **Size and Compression Characteristics**  
   - **Text Files (`txt`)**:
     - Large text files may generate substantial I/O overhead due to the number of lines or the verbosity of line breaks.
   - **JSON Files**:
     - JSON often serializes data more compactly, especially for structured data, reducing the overall I/O load.

---

### 6. **File-System Caching Effects**  
   - Modern operating systems cache frequently accessed or written files. JSON output (written in fewer operations) might benefit from more efficient caching compared to numerous smaller writes for text files.

---

### How to Confirm This Behavior:
You can test and measure the performance difference explicitly by:
1. **Timing Specific Sections**:
   - Use Python's `time` module to measure the duration of text versus JSON writing.
   ```python
   import time
   
   start_time = time.time()
   # Your file writing code here
   end_time = time.time()
   print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
   ```
2. **Inspecting System I/O**:
   - Use tools like `iotop` or profiling libraries (`cProfile`) to see how much I/O the script performs during the writing phase.

---

### Conclusion:
JSON output appears faster primarily because it minimizes intermediate processing and consolidates writing into a single operation, while text file output involves line-by-line manipulation and multiple write operations. If speed is critical and the format isn't constrained, JSON might indeed be the better choice.
