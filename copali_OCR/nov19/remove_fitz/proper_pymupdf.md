You're absolutely correct that `fitz` is often mistakenly assumed to refer to PyMuPDF in some setups, but it can lead to confusion when there are overlapping namespaces or inheritance issues.

Hereâ€™s how to handle this and ensure clarity:

### **Steps to Mark and Resolve Import Issues**

1. **Explicitly Reference PyMuPDF**:
   When using `fitz` from PyMuPDF, ensure it is clear in the code that this is the intended library. You can do this by:

   ```python
   import fitz  # PyMuPDF library for handling PDFs
   ```

2. **Resolve Namespace Issues**:
   If there's ambiguity because another library or custom module uses `fitz`, you can alias the import:
   ```python
   import fitz as pymupdf  # Alias to clarify it's PyMuPDF
   ```

   Update all calls in the file to use `pymupdf`, such as:
   ```python
   doc = pymupdf.open("example.pdf")
   ```

3. **Mark and Comment the Dependency**:
   Add comments or a block of documentation in the code to warn future developers about the potential confusion:
   ```python
   # Important: Ensure 'fitz' refers to PyMuPDF. 
   # Other libraries may use the same name and cause conflicts.
   import fitz  # PyMuPDF library for handling PDFs
   ```

4. **Test the Dependency**:
   Verify that PyMuPDF is correctly installed and used:
   ```bash
   pip install PyMuPDF
   python -c "import fitz; print(fitz.__doc__)"
   ```
   If `fitz` isn't resolving to PyMuPDF, you may need to clean up your Python environment or clarify imports further.

5. **Use Virtual Environments**:
   If you're encountering inheritance problems due to overlapping libraries, isolate your dependencies in a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   pip install PyMuPDF
   ```

6. **Log Issues in Documentation**:
   Add a README or inline comments to flag this issue for others:
   ```
   # Known Issue: The 'fitz' module from PyMuPDF may conflict with similarly named modules.
   # Ensure you're importing PyMuPDF. Aliasing as 'pymupdf' is recommended for clarity.
   ```

### **Next Steps**
- Review and refactor all imports of `fitz` in your project.
- If you identify conflicts from other modules or custom scripts, consider renaming them to avoid collisions.

Let me know if you'd like assistance refactoring the imports or testing the setup!
