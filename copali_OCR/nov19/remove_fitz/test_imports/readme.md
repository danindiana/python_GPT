Here's a one-liner bash script that tests the imports and installs any missing packages using `pip`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python -c 'import os, subprocess, sys; [subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", pkg]) for pkg in ["pytesseract", "torch", "Pillow", "pypdfium2", "colpali_engine", "json"] if not os.path.exists(f"{sys.executable}-{pkg}")]'
```

This script does the following:

1. The shebang line `#!/bin/bash` specifies that this is a bash script.
2. The `python -c` command allows you to execute Python code directly from the command line.
3. The Python code inside the `python -c` command block does the following:
   - It imports the necessary modules: `os`, `subprocess`, and `sys`.
   - It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list of packages.
   - For each package, it checks if the package is already installed by looking for the corresponding executable file in the Python environment using `os.path.exists(f"{sys.executable}-{pkg}")`.
   - If the package is not found, it uses `subprocess.check_call()` to run the `pip install` command for that package.

To use this one-liner script, save it to a file (e.g., `import_test.sh`) and make it executable using `chmod +x import_test.sh`. Then, you can run the script by executing `./import_test.sh` in your terminal.

Please note that this script assumes you have the necessary permissions to install packages using `pip` in your Python environment. Also, keep in mind that automatically installing packages may have unintended consequences, such as installing incompatible versions or overwriting existing packages. It's generally recommended to manually manage your dependencies and ensure compatibility.

The script I provided earlier only tests the imports for the listed packages. It assumes that the packages are already installed in your Python environment. If a package is not installed, the script will raise an `ImportError` for that specific package.

If you want to test the imports and automatically install any missing packages, you can modify the script to catch the `ImportError` and attempt to install the package using `pip`. Here's an updated version of the script that does this:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def install(package):
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])

def test_imports():
    print("Testing imports...")
    
    try:
        import os
        print(f"os version: {os.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("os not found. Installing...")
        install("os")
    
    try:
        import pytesseract
        print(f"pytesseract version: {pytesseract.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("pytesseract not found. Installing...")
        install("pytesseract")
    
    try:
        import torch
        print(f"torch version: {torch.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("torch not found. Installing...")
        install("torch")
    
    try:
        from PIL import Image, ImageOps
        print(f"PIL version: {PIL.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("PIL not found. Installing...")
        install("Pillow")
    
    try:
        from pypdfium2 import PdfDocument
        print(f"pypdfium2 version: {PdfDocument.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("pypdfium2 not found. Installing...")
        install("pypdfium2")
    
    try:
        from colpali_engine.models import ColQwen2, ColQwen2Processor
        print(f"colpali_engine version: {ColQwen2.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("colpali_engine not found. Installing...")
        install("colpali_engine")
    
    try:
        import subprocess
        print(f"subprocess version: {subprocess.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("subprocess not found. Installing...")
        install("subprocess")
    
    try:
        import gc
        print(f"gc version: {gc.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("gc not found. Installing...")
        install("gc")
    
    try:
        import json
        print(f"json version: {json.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("json not found. Installing...")
        install("json")
    
    print("All imports tested successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_imports()
```

In this updated script, each `import` statement is wrapped in a `try-except` block. If an `ImportError` is caught, the script prints a message indicating that the package is not found and attempts to install it using `pip` by calling the `install()` function.

Please note that this script assumes you have the necessary permissions to install packages using `pip` in your Python environment. Also, keep in mind that automatically installing packages may have unintended consequences, such as installing incompatible versions or overwriting existing packages. It's generally recommended to manually manage your dependencies and ensure compatibility.

Here's a Python script that tests the imports for the packages you listed:

```python
import os
import pytesseract
import torch
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from pypdfium2 import PdfDocument
from colpali_engine.models import ColQwen2, ColQwen2Processor
import subprocess
import gc
import json

def test_imports():
    print("Testing imports...")
    
    print(f"os version: {os.__version__}")
    print(f"pytesseract version: {pytesseract.__version__}")
    print(f"torch version: {torch.__version__}")
    print(f"PIL version: {PIL.__version__}")
    print(f"pypdfium2 version: {PdfDocument.__version__}")
    print(f"colpali_engine version: {ColQwen2.__version__}")
    print(f"subprocess version: {subprocess.__version__}")
    print(f"gc version: {gc.__version__}")
    print(f"json version: {json.__version__}")

    print("All imports tested successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_imports()
```

This script attempts to import each package and prints the version of the package if the import is successful. If any of the imports fail, you will see an `ImportError` message, indicating that the package is not installed in your Python environment.

To run this script, save it to a file (e.g., `test_imports.py`) and execute it using Python:

```
python test_imports.py
```

The script will output the version of each successfully imported package and display a success message at the end if all imports are successful.
