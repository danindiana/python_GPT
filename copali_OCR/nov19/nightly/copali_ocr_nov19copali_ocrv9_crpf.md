This code is a comprehensive script designed to process PDF files, extract text and images, and perform various operations such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition), text preprocessing, and similarity scoring using a deep learning model. Below is a detailed explanation of how the code works:

### 1. **Imports and Environment Setup**
   - **Imports**: The script imports various libraries including `os`, `pytesseract`, `pymupdf`, `torch`, `PIL`, `pypdfium2`, and custom modules from `colpali_engine`.
   - **TESSDATA_PREFIX**: The script sets the `TESSDATA_PREFIX` environment variable to specify the path to Tesseract OCR's language data. It then verifies the existence of the directory and the `eng.traineddata` file.

### 2. **Image Preprocessing for OCR**
   - **`preprocess_image_for_ocr(image)`**: This function preprocesses an image to improve OCR accuracy. It converts the image to grayscale, increases contrast, and applies a binary threshold.

### 3. **Text Extraction from PDF**
   - **`extract_text_without_ocr(pdf_path)`**: This function attempts to extract embedded text directly from a PDF using PyMuPDF (`pymupdf`). If the PDF contains embedded text, it is extracted without using OCR.

### 4. **Image and Text Extraction with OCR**
   - **`extract_images_and_text_ocr(pdf_path, resize_factor=2)`**: This function extracts images and text from a PDF. If the PDF does not contain embedded text, it uses OCR to extract text from images. The images are resized and preprocessed before OCR.

### 5. **Text Chunking**
   - **`split_text_into_chunks(text, chunk_size)`**: This function splits a large text into smaller chunks of a specified size, which is useful for processing large texts in manageable parts.

### 6. **GPU Information and Selection**
   - **`get_gpu_info()`**: This function fetches GPU information using `nvidia-smi` and returns a list of available GPUs along with their utilization.
   - **`select_gpu(gpus)`**: This function prompts the user to select a GPU from the available options.

### 7. **Progress Tracking**
   - **`load_progress()`**: Loads the list of processed files from a log file.
   - **`save_progress(processed_files)`**: Saves the list of processed files to a log file.

### 8. **Output Saving**
   - **`save_output(output_file, content, file_format)`**: Saves the extracted text to a specified file format (txt, json, csv).

### 9. **User Input and Directory Verification**
   - The script prompts the user to input the target directory containing PDF files, the output directory for processed text files, and the desired output format. It then verifies that the directories exist.

### 10. **Processing PDF Files**
   - **Loading Progress**: The script loads the list of already processed files to avoid reprocessing them.
   - **Filtering Files**: It filters out PDF files that have already been processed.
   - **Resume or Start Fresh**: The user is prompted to decide whether to resume from the last stop or start fresh.
   - **GPU Selection**: The user selects a GPU for processing.

### 11. **Model Loading**
   - The script loads a deep learning model (`ColQwen2`) and its processor (`ColQwen2Processor`) onto the selected GPU. The model is set to evaluation mode and uses half-precision (`torch.float16`) to save memory.

### 12. **Processing Each PDF File**
   - **File Length Check**: The script skips files with names longer than 200 characters.
   - **Text and Image Extraction**: It extracts images and text from each PDF file. If the PDF contains embedded text, it uses that; otherwise, it uses OCR.
   - **Saving OCR Output**: The OCR-like text is saved to a file in the output directory.
   - **Image Processing**: The script processes images in batches to prevent out-of-memory errors. It generates embeddings for the images using the deep learning model.
   - **Text Processing**: If the PDF contains text, the script splits it into chunks and processes each chunk using the model. It calculates similarity scores between the text chunks and image embeddings.
   - **Progress Saving**: After processing each file, the script saves the progress to the log file.

### 13. **Error Handling and Final Cleanup**
   - **Error Handling**: The script catches and logs any errors that occur during processing.
   - **Memory Cleanup**: After processing, the script clears GPU memory and garbage collects to free up resources.
   - **Skipped Files**: The script lists any files that were skipped due to errors or other issues.

### Summary
This script is a sophisticated tool for processing PDF files, extracting text and images, and performing deep learning-based operations such as OCR and similarity scoring. It includes robust error handling, progress tracking, and memory management to ensure efficient and reliable processing of large volumes of PDF files.
