This code is a comprehensive script designed to process PDF files, extract text and images, and perform similarity calculations between the extracted text and images using a deep learning model. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the code works:

### 1. **Imports and Environment Setup**
   - **Imports**: The script imports several libraries:
     - `os` for file and directory operations.
     - `pytesseract` for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
     - `fitz` (PyMuPDF) for direct text extraction from PDFs.
     - `PIL` (Pillow) for image processing.
     - `pypdfium2` for handling PDF documents.
     - `torch` for deep learning operations.
     - `ColQwen2` and `ColQwen2Processor` from a custom module `colpali_engine.models`.
   - **Environment Variable**: The `TESSDATA_PREFIX` environment variable is set to specify the directory containing Tesseract's language data files.

### 2. **Image Preprocessing for OCR**
   - **`preprocess_image_for_ocr(image)`**: This function preprocesses an image to improve OCR accuracy. It converts the image to grayscale, increases contrast, and applies a binary threshold to make text more distinct.

### 3. **Direct Text Extraction from PDF**
   - **`extract_text_without_ocr(pdf_path)`**: This function attempts to extract text directly from a PDF using PyMuPDF (`fitz`). It iterates through each page of the PDF and extracts the text using `page.get_text("text")`.

### 4. **OCR-Based Text Extraction from PDF**
   - **`extract_images_and_text_ocr(pdf_path, resize_factor=2)`**: This function first tries to extract text directly using `extract_text_without_ocr`. If no text is found, it falls back to OCR. It renders each page of the PDF as an image, resizes it to save memory, preprocesses it, and then runs OCR using `pytesseract.image_to_string`. The extracted text and images are returned.

### 5. **GPU and Model Setup**
   - **GPU Setup**: The script sets the primary GPU to `cuda:0`.
   - **Model and Processor Loading**: The `ColQwen2` model and its processor are loaded from a pretrained checkpoint. The model is placed on the GPU and set to evaluation mode.

### 6. **PDF File Selection and Processing**
   - **PDF File Selection**: The script scans the current directory for PDF files, displays them in a menu, and allows the user to select one or more PDFs to process.
   - **Processing Selected PDFs**: For each selected PDF, the script extracts images and text using `extract_images_and_text_ocr`. If OCR is used, the extracted text is saved to a file.

### 7. **Image and Text Processing**
   - **Image Processing**: The script processes images in batches to prevent out-of-memory errors. Each batch of images is processed by the model to generate image embeddings.
   - **Text Processing**: If text is available, it is processed by the model to generate text embeddings.

### 8. **Similarity Calculation**
   - **Similarity Scores**: If both image and text embeddings are available, the script calculates similarity scores between the text embeddings and each image embedding using the `processor.score_multi_vector` method.

### 9. **Final Memory Cleanup**
   - **`torch.cuda.empty_cache()`**: The script clears the GPU cache to free up memory after processing each PDF.

### Summary
This script is designed to handle PDF files by first attempting to extract text directly and falling back to OCR if necessary. It then processes the extracted images and text using a deep learning model to generate embeddings. Finally, it calculates similarity scores between the text and images, providing insights into how closely related the text and images are. The script is robust, handling batch processing and memory management to ensure it can handle large PDFs and multiple files efficiently.
