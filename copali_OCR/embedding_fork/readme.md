Sorting and filtering your text files by topicality and quality can be achieved using a combination of machine learning techniques and rule-based filters. Since you want to filter for specific topics and languages efficiently, here’s a step-by-step approach tailored to your hardware and requirements:

---

### **1. Language Filtering (Non-English Exclusion)**
Before diving into topicality, filter out non-English documents. This is computationally cheap and narrows your dataset.

- **Tools:** 
  - **FastText's language identification model**: It is lightweight and fast, ideal for bulk processing text files.
    ```bash
    pip install fasttext
    ```
    Example usage in Python:
    ```python
    import fasttext

    model = fasttext.load_model('lid.176.bin')  # Pretrained language ID model
    def detect_language(text):
        lang, confidence = model.predict(text)
        return lang[0], confidence[0]

    # Filter English documents
    english_docs = [file for file in text_files if detect_language(file_text)[0] == '__label__en']
    ```
  - **LangDetect (Python)** or **Polyglot**: Simpler alternatives to FastText but slightly less accurate.

---

### **2. Topical Filtering**
To sort by topicality (e.g., scientific papers, STEM content), you can use pre-trained models to classify the documents based on their content.

#### **Options for Topical Filtering**
1. **Rule-Based Keyword Matching (Baseline)**
   - Use regular expressions or keyword matching to detect STEM/scientific keywords in text.
   - Example: Check for terms like "algorithm," "experiment," "dataset," "device," etc.
   - Tools: `re` module in Python, or simple pattern matching libraries.

2. **Pre-trained Topic Classification Models**
   - Use lightweight text classification models like:
     - **DistilBERT**: A smaller, faster BERT model.
     - **SVM** or **Logistic Regression**: Train a traditional ML model on embeddings (e.g., TF-IDF or SentenceTransformers).
   - Pre-trained topical classifiers (e.g., `HuggingFace Transformers`) for domain-specific content filtering.
   - Example with HuggingFace:
     ```bash
     pip install transformers
     ```
     ```python
     from transformers import pipeline

     classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="distilbert-base-uncased")
     def classify_document(text):
         result = classifier(text, truncation=True)
         return result[0]['label'], result[0]['score']

     # Filter by desired topics
     filtered_docs = [file for file in text_files if 'science' in classify_document(file_text)[0].lower()]
     ```

3. **Fine-Tune a Simple Model (Custom)**
   - Fine-tune a smaller model (e.g., DistilBERT, TinyBERT) on labeled data of your specific domains (scientific, STEM, manuals).
   - Dataset: Use public datasets like **ArXiv**, **PubMed**, and **manuals datasets** to pre-train or fine-tune.

4. **Embedding-based Filtering with Clustering**
   - Generate embeddings (e.g., SentenceTransformers or OpenAI embeddings) for all documents.
   - Cluster them using algorithms like **KMeans** or **HDBSCAN** and filter clusters relevant to your domain.
   - Example with SentenceTransformers:
     ```bash
     pip install sentence-transformers
     ```
     ```python
     from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
     from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

     model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Lightweight model
     embeddings = [model.encode(text) for text in text_files]

     kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42).fit(embeddings)
     topic_clusters = kmeans.predict(embeddings)

     # Select clusters manually or based on keyword/topic analysis
     selected_cluster_docs = [text_files[i] for i, cluster in enumerate(topic_clusters) if cluster in [desired_clusters]]
     ```

---

### **3. Remove Noise and Redundant Content**
- **Deduplication**: Use hash-based deduplication or embedding similarity (cosine similarity) to remove near-duplicates.
- **Remove HTML/Metadata Artifacts**: Strip out leftover web scraping noise using tools like `BeautifulSoup` or regular expressions.
- **Filter by Length**: Exclude documents that are too short (likely irrelevant).

---

### **4. Compute-Efficient Strategy**
- Leverage smaller models optimized for your GPU (RTX 4080 SUPER) and batch process texts.
- Recommended models:
  - **DistilBERT**, **MiniLM**, or **TinyBERT** for embeddings and classification.
  - SentenceTransformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for lightweight embeddings.
- Tools like **HuggingFace Datasets** for parallel processing.

---

### **5. Workflow Example**
Here’s a Python workflow:
```python
import os
from transformers import pipeline
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Paths
text_dir = "/path/to/text/files"
filtered_dir = "/path/to/filtered/files"

# Load models
language_model = fasttext.load_model('lid.176.bin')
topic_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Process documents
for file in os.listdir(text_dir):
    with open(os.path.join(text_dir, file), 'r') as f:
        text = f.read()
    
    # Step 1: Language filter
    lang, confidence = language_model.predict(text)
    if lang[0] != '__label__en': continue  # Skip non-English docs
    
    # Step 2: Generate embeddings and filter by topic
    embedding = topic_model.encode(text)
    # Apply clustering/classification logic here...
    # Save if passes filter
    with open(os.path.join(filtered_dir, file), 'w') as out:
        out.write(text)
```

This setup will help you efficiently filter your text files for the desired content. Let me know if you want more details on specific steps!
