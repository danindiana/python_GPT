To determine which elements of the program are run on the GPU and which are run on the CPU, we need to identify the parts of the code that involve GPU operations and those that do not. Here's a breakdown of the key elements in your program:

### Elements Run on the GPU:
1. **Model Loading and Evaluation**:
   - The model (`ColQwen2`) is loaded onto the GPU using `.to(device)`.
   - The model is evaluated in inference mode using `.eval()`.

   ```python
   device = torch.device("cuda:0")
   model = ColQwen2.from_pretrained(
       "vidore/colqwen2-v0.1",
       torch_dtype=torch.float16  # Ensure half-precision to save memory
   ).to(device).eval()
   ```

2. **Image Processing**:
   - The images are processed and moved to the GPU using `.to(device)`.

   ```python
   batch_images = processor.process_images(image_batch).to(device)
   ```

3. **Text Processing**:
   - The text chunks are processed and moved to the GPU using `.to(device)`.

   ```python
   batch_queries = processor.process_queries(queries).to(device)
   ```

4. **Model Inference**:
   - The model performs inference on the GPU.

   ```python
   with torch.no_grad():
       image_embeddings = model(**batch_images)
       query_embeddings = model(**batch_queries)
   ```

5. **Memory Management**:
   - GPU memory is freed using `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`.

   ```python
   torch.cuda.empty_cache()
   ```

### Elements Run on the CPU:
1. **File Handling and I/O Operations**:
   - Reading and writing files.
   - Directory verification.

   ```python
   input_dir = input("Enter the path of the target directory containing PDF files: ")
   output_dir = input("Enter the path of the output directory for processed text files: ")

   if not os.path.isdir(input_dir):
       print("The target directory does not exist.")
       exit()
   if not os.path.isdir(output_dir):
       print("The output directory does not exist.")
       exit()
   ```

2. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Converting images to grayscale.
   - Applying contrast and thresholding.

   ```python
   def preprocess_image_for_ocr(image):
       image = image.convert("L")  # Convert to grayscale
       image = ImageOps.autocontrast(image)  # Increase contrast
       image = image.point(lambda x: 0 if x < 128 else 255, '1')  # Apply binary threshold
       return image
   ```

3. **Text Extraction and Processing**:
   - Extracting text from PDFs.
   - Splitting text into chunks.

   ```python
   def extract_text_without_ocr(pdf_path):
       text = ""
       try:
           with fitz.open(pdf_path) as doc:
               for page_num in range(len(doc)):
                   page = doc[page_num]
                   text += f"\n--- Page {page_num + 1} ---\n"
                   text += page.get_text("text")  # Direct text extraction
       except fitz.FileDataError:
           print(f"Failed to open file {pdf_path}. Skipping...")
       return text

   def split_text_into_chunks(text, chunk_size):
       words = text.split()
       return [" ".join(words[i:i + chunk_size]) for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size)]
   ```

4. **OCR Operations**:
   - Performing OCR on preprocessed images.

   ```python
   page_ocr_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(processed_image)
   ```

5. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - Printing debug information.

   ```python
   print(f"Processing image batch {i} for {pdf_file}...")
   print(f"Processing text chunk for {pdf_file}...")
   ```

### Summary:
- **GPU Operations**: Model loading, evaluation, image and text processing, model inference, and memory management.
- **CPU Operations**: File handling, image preprocessing, text extraction, OCR operations, and debugging/logging.

### Optimizing GPU Usage:
To optimize GPU usage, you can:
1. **Reduce Batch Size**: As mentioned earlier, reduce the batch size to minimize GPU memory usage.
2. **Use Mixed Precision**: Ensure that you are using mixed precision (float16) to reduce memory usage.
3. **Free GPU Memory**: Ensure that GPU memory is freed after each batch processing using `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`.
4. **Optimize Data**: Reduce the size of the images or text chunks to minimize memory usage.
5. **Use CPU for Certain Operations**: Move certain operations that do not require GPU to the CPU to free up GPU memory.

Certainly! The idea behind moving certain operations that do not require GPU to the CPU is to free up GPU memory for operations that are computationally intensive and benefit significantly from GPU acceleration. This can help mitigate memory constraints and improve overall performance.

### Specific Operations to Move to CPU:

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Converting images to grayscale.
   - Applying contrast and thresholding.
   - Resizing images.

   These operations are relatively lightweight and do not require the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU. Moving them to the CPU can free up GPU memory for more intensive tasks like model inference.

2. **Text Extraction and Processing**:
   - Extracting text from PDFs.
   - Splitting text into chunks.

   These operations are also lightweight and can be efficiently handled by the CPU.

3. **File Handling and I/O Operations**:
   - Reading and writing files.
   - Directory verification.

   These operations are inherently CPU-bound and do not benefit from GPU acceleration.

### Implementation Strategy:

1. **Move Image Preprocessing to CPU**:
   - Ensure that image preprocessing operations are performed on the CPU before moving the processed images to the GPU.

2. **Move Text Extraction and Processing to CPU**:
   - Ensure that text extraction and processing operations are performed on the CPU before moving the processed text to the GPU.

3. **Move File Handling and I/O Operations to CPU**:
   - Ensure that file handling and I/O operations are performed on the CPU.

### Explanation:
1. **Image Preprocessing**: The `preprocess_image_for_ocr` function is performed on the CPU.
2. **Text Extraction and Processing**: The `extract_text_without_ocr` and `split_text_into_chunks` functions are performed on the CPU.
3. **File Handling and I/O Operations**: File handling and I/O operations are performed on the CPU.
4. **Model Inference**: Model inference is performed on the GPU.

By moving these operations to the CPU, you can free up GPU memory for more intensive tasks like model inference, which can help mitigate memory constraints and improve overall performance.
