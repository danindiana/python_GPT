The error message "corrupted size vs. prev_size" indicates a memory corruption issue, which is often related to improper memory management or use of external libraries that have memory issues. This can be tricky to debug, but here are some steps to help diagnose and potentially fix the issue:

### 1. **Check for Memory Corruption**
Ensure that all memory allocations and deallocations are properly managed. In Python, this is less of an issue since Python's garbage collector handles memory management. However, if you are using external libraries or C extensions, this could still be a problem.

### 2. **Update and Reinstall Libraries**
Ensure that all your libraries are up to date and properly installed. Sometimes, bugs in libraries can cause such issues.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pytesseract fitz pypdfium2 torch colpali_engine
```

### 3. **Check for Known Issues in Libraries**
Look for any known issues or bugs in the libraries you are using. Sometimes, these issues are documented and can provide clues on how to fix them.

### 4. **Simplify and Isolate the Problem**
Try to simplify your code to isolate the problem. For example, comment out parts of the code to see if the issue persists. This can help identify which part of the code is causing the problem.

### 5. **Use Memory Profiling Tools**
Use memory profiling tools to identify where the memory issues might be occurring. Tools like `memory_profiler` in Python can help you track memory usage.

### 6. **Check for External Dependencies**
Ensure that all external dependencies (like Tesseract, PyMuPDF, etc.) are correctly installed and configured. Sometimes, issues can arise from mismatched versions or incorrect installations.

### 7. **Read the Core Dump**
A core dump is a file that contains the memory image of the process at the time it crashed. You can use tools like `gdb` (GNU Debugger) to analyze the core dump.

#### Steps to Analyze the Core Dump:

1. **Install `gdb`**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install gdb
   ```

2. **Locate the Core Dump File**:
   The core dump file is usually located in the directory where the program was run. It might be named something like `core`, `core.PID`, or `core.PID.timestamp`.

3. **Load the Core Dump with `gdb`**:
   ```bash
   gdb python core.PID
   ```

4. **Analyze the Core Dump**:
   Once `gdb` is loaded with the core dump, you can use various commands to analyze the dump. Some useful commands include:
   - `bt`: Print a backtrace of the stack.
   - `info threads`: List all threads and their current stack frames.
   - `info locals`: Print local variables in the current stack frame.
   - `info frame`: Display detailed information about the selected stack frame.

### Example of Using `gdb`:

```bash
gdb python core.PID
(gdb) bt
(gdb) info threads
(gdb) info locals
(gdb) info frame
```

### Explanation:
1. **Debugging Information**: Added print statements to indicate which part of the code is being executed.
2. **Error Handling**: Added try-except blocks around the model processing parts to catch and print any exceptions that occur.
3. **Memory Cleanup**: Ensured `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is called after each batch processing to free up GPU memory.

### Next Steps:
1. **Run the Updated Code**: Run the updated code to see if the issue persists.
2. **Check Logs and Output**: Check the logs and output to see if any specific file or part of the code is causing the issue.
3. **Analyze the Core Dump**: Use `gdb` to analyze the core dump and identify where the memory corruption occurs.

If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the maintainers of the libraries you are using for further assistance.

The error message indicates that the program is running out of GPU memory while processing the text chunk for the file `rendiconto_generale_RG2011.pdf`. This is a common issue when working with large models and large datasets on GPUs with limited memory.

Here are some strategies to mitigate this issue:

### 1. **Reduce Batch Size**
Reduce the batch size to allocate less memory per batch. This can help avoid running out of GPU memory.

### 2. **Use Gradient Accumulation**
If you need to maintain a large effective batch size, you can use gradient accumulation. This technique involves accumulating gradients over several smaller batches before performing a backward pass.

### 3. **Free GPU Memory**
Ensure that GPU memory is freed after each batch processing. You are already using `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`, which is good.

### 4. **Use Mixed Precision**
Ensure that you are using mixed precision (float16) to reduce memory usage. You are already using `torch_dtype=torch.float16`, which is good.

### 5. **Optimize Model and Data**
Optimize the model and data preprocessing to reduce memory usage. For example, you can reduce the size of the images or text chunks.

### 6. **Use CPU for Certain Operations**
For certain operations that do not require GPU, you can move them to the CPU to free up GPU memory.

### Explanation:
1. **Reduced Batch Size**: The batch size for processing images is reduced to 1 to minimize GPU memory usage.
2. **Debugging Information**: Added print statements to indicate which part of the code is being executed.
3. **Error Handling**: Added try-except blocks around the model processing parts to catch and print any exceptions that occur.
4. **Memory Cleanup**: Ensured `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is called after each batch processing to free up GPU memory.

### Next Steps:
1. **Run the Updated Code**: Run the updated code to see if the issue persists.
2. **Check Logs and Output**: Check the logs and output to see if any specific file or part of the code is causing the issue.
3. **Optimize Further**: If the issue persists, consider further optimizations such as reducing the size of the images or text chunks, or using CPU for certain operations.

If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the maintainers of the libraries you are using for further assistance.
