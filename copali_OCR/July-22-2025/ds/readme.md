This is a comprehensive Python script for advanced PDF OCR processing using multiple state-of-the-art models. Let me analyze its key components:

1. **Core Features**:
   - Supports multiple OCR models (Phi-3 Vision, Nougat, TrOCR) with automatic GPU detection
   - Handles both text and mathematical equations
   - Includes sophisticated text cleaning and LaTeX conversion
   - Can process PDFs recursively through directories
   - Provides contamination filtering for non-relevant characters

2. **Model Support**:
   - **Phi-3 Vision**: Microsoft's multimodal model for general OCR
   - **Nougat**: Facebook's academic paper-focused OCR
   - **TrOCR**: Microsoft's text-specific OCR model
   - **Math OCR**: Specialized equation recognition

3. **Key Functions**:
   - `clean_ocr_text()`: Handles symbol corrections and formatting
   - `remove_ocr_contamination()`: Filters out unwanted characters
   - `extract_page_content()`: Main processing logic combining multiple methods
   - `process_pdf()`: Handles individual PDF processing

4. **Usage Options**:
   - Recursive directory processing
   - User confirmation prompts
   - LaTeX cleaning
   - Contamination filtering
   - GPU selection

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive try-catch blocks
   - Multiple fallback methods for PDF rendering
   - Graceful degradation when models fail to load

6. **Requirements**:
   - PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF handling
   - PIL/Pillow for image processing
   - PyTorch for model inference
   - Transformers library for OCR models
   - Tesseract OCR (optional)

To use this script:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pymupdf pillow pytesseract torch transformers
```

2. Run with options like:
```bash
python script.py input_folder output_folder --ocr-model phi3-vision --recursive
```

The script is particularly well-suited for academic papers and technical documents, with special handling for mathematical notation and LaTeX content. The contamination filtering makes it robust against OCR artifacts in multilingual documents.
