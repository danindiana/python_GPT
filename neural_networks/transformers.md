The provided code snippets outline the key components of a Transformer model, including Scaled Dot-Product Attention, Multi-Head Attention, Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks, and the Transformer Encoder and Decoder layers. Below is a detailed explanation of each component and some notes on implementation:

---

### 1. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**
```c
function scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V):
    n = Q.shape[1]  // Sequence length
    d_k = Q.shape[0]  // Dimension of keys

    // Calculate dot products between Q and K, add scaling factor, and apply softmax
    attention = softmax( Q * K^T / sqrt(d_k) ) * V
    
    return attention
```

- **Purpose**: Computes attention scores between queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V).
- **Steps**:
  1. Compute the dot product between Q and K.
  2. Scale the dot product by the square root of the key dimension (`sqrt(d_k)`).
  3. Apply the softmax function to obtain attention weights.
  4. Multiply the attention weights by the values (V) to get the output.
- **Note**: The scaling factor (`sqrt(d_k)`) prevents the dot product from becoming too large, which can lead to vanishing gradients in the softmax function.

### 2. **Multi-Head Attention**
```c
function multi_head_attention(Q, K, V):
    n = Q.shape[1]  // Sequence length
    d_model = Q.shape[0]  // Total model dimension
    
    heads = []
    for i in [1..h]:
        WQ, WK, WV = linear_layer(Q, K, V)  // Linear projections for each head
        attention_i = scaled_dot_product_attention(WQ, WK, WV)
        heads.append(attention_i)

    Concatenate the outputs from all heads and apply a final linear transformation
    return linear_layer(concat(heads))
```

- **Purpose**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously by using multiple attention heads.
- **Steps**:
  1. For each head, linearly project Q, K, and V into lower-dimensional spaces.
  2. Compute attention using `scaled_dot_product_attention` for each head.
  3. Concatenate the outputs of all heads.
  4. Apply a final linear transformation to combine the concatenated outputs.
- **Note**: The number of heads (`h`) is a hyperparameter, and the projections ensure that the total dimensionality remains consistent with `d_model`.

### 3. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**
```c
function feed_forward(x):
    intermediate_output = relu(linear_layer_1(x))
    output = linear_layer_2(intermediate_output)
    
    return output
```

- **Purpose**: Applies a two-layer feed-forward network to each position in the sequence independently.
- **Steps**:
  1. Apply a linear transformation to the input.
  2. Apply the ReLU activation function.
  3. Apply a second linear transformation.
- **Note**: The intermediate dimension is typically larger than the input dimension, allowing the network to learn complex transformations.

### 4. **Transformer Encoder Layer**
```c
function transformer_encoder_layer(Q, K, V):
    self_attention_output = multi_head_attention(Q, K, V)  // Self-attention layer
    
    ff_output = feed_forward(self_attention_output)  // Position-wise FFN layer
    
    // Residual connections and layer normalization (not shown)
    
    return ff_output
```

- **Purpose**: Combines self-attention and feed-forward layers to process the input sequence.
- **Steps**:
  1. Apply multi-head self-attention to the input.
  2. Apply a position-wise feed-forward network to the attention output.
  3. Add residual connections and layer normalization (not explicitly shown in the code).
- **Note**: Residual connections help in gradient flow, and layer normalization stabilizes training.

### 5. **Transformer Decoder Layer**
```c
function transformer_decoder_layer(Q, K, V):
    self_attention_output_1 = multi_head_attention(Q, Q, V)  // Self-attention in decoder

    encoder_decoder_attention_output = multi_head_attention(self_attention_output_1, K, V)  // Encoder-decoder attention
    
    ff_output = feed_forward(encoder_decoder_attention_output)  // Position-wise FFN layer
    
    // Residual connections and layer normalization (not shown)
    
    return ff_output
```

- **Purpose**: Processes the target sequence and attends to the encoder output.
- **Steps**:
  1. Apply self-attention to the target sequence (masked to prevent attending to future tokens).
  2. Apply encoder-decoder attention to combine the decoder output with the encoder output.
  3. Apply a position-wise feed-forward network.
  4. Add residual connections and layer normalization (not explicitly shown in the code).
- **Note**: The decoder has two attention layers: one for self-attention and one for attending to the encoder output.

### 6. **Transformer Model**
```c
function transformer_model(X, num_layers):
    output = embedding_layer(X)  // Embedding layer for input tokens
    
    for i in [1..num_layers]:
        output = transformer_encoder_layer(output, output, output)  // Encoder layers

    for i in [1..num_layers]:
        output = transformer_decoder_layer(output, encoder_output, output)  // Decoder layers

    final_output = linear_layer(output)  // Final linear transformation to logits
    
    return final_output
```

- **Purpose**: Combines encoder and decoder layers to process input and generate output sequences.
- **Steps**:
  1. Apply an embedding layer to convert input tokens into vectors.
  2. Pass the embeddings through multiple encoder layers.
  3. Pass the encoder output through multiple decoder layers.
  4. Apply a final linear transformation to produce logits for the output tokens.
- **Note**: The number of layers (`num_layers`) is a hyperparameter. The decoder attends to both the encoder output and its own output.

### Summary
The Transformer model is composed of:
1. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Computes attention scores.
2. **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows multiple attention mechanisms.
3. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**: Processes each position independently.
4. **Encoder Layer**: Combines self-attention and feed-forward layers.
5. **Decoder Layer**: Combines self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward layers.
6. **Transformer Model**: Combines encoder and decoder layers to process input and generate output.

This structure enables the Transformer to handle sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, text generation, and more.
