# Database Integration (SQLAlchemy): Uses SQLAlchemy to store job data in a database (SQLite for simplicity). This allows for persistent storage of job listings.

Job Details Page: Added a job_details route to display the full details of a specific job listing.

#Posting Jobs: A post_job route allows users to submit new job listings. Includes form handling, database insertion, and flashing messages for success/errors.

#Error Handling (Rollback): Added db.session.rollback() in the post_job route to handle potential database errors gracefully. This prevents the database from being left in an inconsistent state.

#Blockchain Placeholder: Added a register_job_on_blockchain function as a placeholder. In a real application, you would integrate with a blockchain library (like Web3.py) here. The function should take the job data, interact with the blockchain, and return the transaction ID. This ID would then be stored in the Job model.

#Templates: Created the necessary HTML templates for displaying job listings, job details, and posting new jobs. Uses Bootstrap for basic styling.

#Flashing Messages: Uses Flask's flash functionality to display messages to the user (e.g., success after posting a job, error messages).

#Security: Added app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'. Important: Replace 'your_secret_key' with a strong, randomly generated secret key in a production environment. This is crucial for security.

To run this:

Install dependencies: pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy
Save: Save the Python code as app.py and the HTML
