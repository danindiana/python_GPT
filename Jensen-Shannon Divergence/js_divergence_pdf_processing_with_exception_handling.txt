Certainly! Let's name the last code file "js_divergence_pdf_processing_with_exception_handling.py".

Here's how the code works step by step:

1. **Import Libraries**: The required libraries are imported, including `os`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `fitz` (PyMuPDF for PDF processing).

2. **Find PDF Files**: The `find_pdf_files` function recursively scans a specified directory to find all PDF files and returns a list of their paths.

3. **Preprocess Text**: The `preprocess_text` function takes a text and a target length as input and pads or truncates the text to the target length.

4. **Calculate Jensen-Shannon Divergence**: The `calculate_js_divergence` function calculates the Jensen-Shannon Divergence between two probability distributions `p` and `q`.

5. **Parse Selection**: The `parse_selection` function takes user input for file selection and parses it into a list of selected indices.

6. **Extract Text from PDF**: The `extract_text_from_pdf` function attempts to extract text from a given PDF file. If an error occurs during extraction, an exception is caught and an error message is displayed.

7. **Convert Windows Path to WSL Path**: The `convert_windows_path_to_wsl_path` function converts a Windows-style path to a WSL-compatible path.

8. **Main Function**: The `main` function is the entry point of the script. It prompts the user to input the root directory to start scanning for PDF files and the target text length for preprocessing.

9. **Find PDF Files**: It uses the `find_pdf_files` function to find PDF files in the specified directory.

10. **Select Files**: It prompts the user to select files by entering numbers/ranges and uses the `parse_selection` function to create a list of selected indices.

11. **Extract Text and Preprocess**: For each selected index, the script attempts to extract text from the corresponding PDF file using the `extract_text_from_pdf` function. If successful, it preprocesses the extracted text using the `preprocess_text` function.

12. **Calculate Jensen-Shannon Divergence**: The script calculates the Jensen-Shannon Divergence between the preprocessed text of the first file and each of the subsequent files.

13. **Display Results**: The script displays the selected files, their extracted and preprocessed text, and the calculated Jensen-Shannon Divergence values.

14. **Sort and Display Results**: If the user chooses to sort the results, the script sorts the calculated Jensen-Shannon Divergence values in descending order and displays them along with the corresponding filenames.

15. **Repeat or Exit**: After displaying the results, the script asks the user if they want to go again. If the user chooses to repeat, the `main` function is called again; otherwise, the script exits.

16. **Entry Point**: The script checks if it's being run directly (not imported as a module) and if so, it calls the `main` function to start the process.

This script provides a user-friendly way to calculate and analyze Jensen-Shannon Divergence between text extracted from selected PDF files. It also includes exception handling to address potential errors during PDF processing and ensures a smoother user experience.
