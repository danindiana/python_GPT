This is a comprehensive Python script for crawling websites to find and download PDF files. Let me break down its key components and functionality:

Key Features:
Asynchronous Crawling:

Uses asyncio and aiohttp for high-performance concurrent crawling

Multiple worker tasks for both crawling and downloading

Intelligent PDF Detection:

Checks file extensions (.pdf)

Examines MIME types

Analyzes link context (text, attributes)

Verifies PDF magic bytes (%PDF)

Robust URL Handling:

URL validation and normalization

Domain restriction options

Depth-limited crawling

Duplicate URL prevention

Polite Crawling:

User-Agent rotation

Rate limiting

Exponential backoff for retries

Connection limits

Error Handling:

Retry logic for temporary failures

JSON file recovery

Comprehensive logging

Statistics Tracking:

Counts processed URLs, found PDFs, downloads, errors

Progress reporting

Main Components:
Configuration:

User agents, MIME types, file extensions

Status code handling

Constants for crawler behavior

Data Classes:

CrawlStats for tracking progress

FetchResult for request outcomes

Helper Functions:

URL validation and processing

PDF detection

Filename sanitization

Content analysis

Core Async Functions:

fetch_url() - Downloads content with retries

download_pdf() - Handles PDF downloads

Worker tasks for crawling and downloading

Main Flow:

Handles user input

Loads URLs from JSON

Coordinates workers

Manages queues

Reports results

Usage:
Prepare a JSON file with starting URLs

Run the script

Configure options:

Number of workers

Crawl depth

Domain restrictions

Save directory

Monitor progress through logs

Find downloaded PDFs in specified directory

Error Recovery:
The script includes features like:

Malformed JSON recovery

Network error retries

Content size validation

Duplicate handling

Performance Considerations:
Async I/O for high concurrency

Queue-based work distribution

Memory limits for large files

Configurable worker counts

This is a production-grade web crawler specifically optimized for PDF discovery while being respectful to web servers. The modular design makes it adaptable for different crawling scenarios.
