How can building such a RAG system enable the creation of more advanced/complex software/AI ensembles? How could it enable language models as agents for example?

Building a robust **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system lays the groundwork for creating **advanced, complex AI ensembles** that leverage the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative AI approaches. Here’s how such a system can serve as a foundational component for enabling **language models as agents** and facilitating the development of more sophisticated AI solutions:

---
