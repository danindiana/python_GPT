Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code:
1. Importing and Initialization:

Importing: The code begins by importing the numpy library as np, which provides various functionalities for working with numerical arrays.
GRUCell Class Definition: A class named GRUCell is defined. This class represents a single GRU cell, which is the basic building block of the GRU network.
init method: This method initializes the GRU cell with its parameters, including:
input_dim: The dimension of the input vector.
hidden_dim: The dimension of the hidden state vector.
W matrices: These matrices represent the weights of the update gate, reset gate, and candidate hidden state calculation.
b vectors: These vectors represent the biases of the update gate, reset gate, and candidate hidden state calculation.
forward method: This method performs the forward pass through the GRU cell, taking the current input vector x and the previous hidden state h_prev as arguments and returning the updated hidden state h.
2. Building the GRU Array:

The code defines the number of cells (num_cells), input dimension (input_dim), and hidden dimension (hidden_dim).
It then creates an array named gru_array using a list comprehension. This array contains num_cells instances of the GRUCell class, each with the specified dimensions.
This effectively creates a multi-layered GRU network with the desired number of cells and hidden units.
3. Processing Inputs:

A hidden state vector (h_prev) is initialized with zeros, representing the initial state of the network.
The code iterates through a batch of input data (input_data) using a loop.
In each iteration:
The current input vector (x) is obtained from the batch data.
The first cell in the gru_array performs the forward pass using x and h_prev, updating the hidden state.
The updated hidden state is then used as input for the subsequent cells in the array, one by one. This process allows information to flow through the entire network.
4. Final Hidden State:

After processing all inputs in the batch, the final hidden state (final_hidden_state) is stored. This hidden state represents the network's current state after processing the entire batch of data.
Overall, this code implements a multi-layered GRU network and demonstrates how to process a batch of input data through the network, updating the hidden state and capturing temporal dependencies in the data.
