This Python program is designed to retrieve a list of IP addresses that are banned by `fail2ban` and then fetch geographical information (GeoIP) for each of those IP addresses. Here's a detailed explanation of how the program works:

### 1. Importing Required Modules

The program imports three modules:

- `subprocess`: This module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
- `requests`: This module is used to send HTTP requests to external APIs.
- `json`: This module is used to parse JSON data returned by the API.

```python
import subprocess
import requests
import json
```

### 2. Function to Get List of Banned IPs

The `get_banned_ips` function retrieves the list of IP addresses that are banned by `fail2ban` and stored in the `f2b_permanent` IP set.

```python
def get_banned_ips():
    result = subprocess.run(['sudo', 'ipset', 'list', 'f2b_permanent'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    banned_ips = []
    for line in result.stdout.splitlines():
        if line and line[0].isdigit():  # Check if the line starts with a digit (an IP)
            banned_ips.append(line.strip())
    return banned_ips
```

#### Explanation:
- **subprocess.run**: This function runs the command `sudo ipset list f2b_permanent`. The `capture_output=True` and `text=True` options capture the output of the command and return it as a string.
- **result.stdout.splitlines()**: This splits the output into individual lines.
- **line[0].isdigit()**: This checks if the line starts with a digit, which indicates that it is an IP address.
- **banned_ips.append(line.strip())**: This adds the IP address to the `banned_ips` list.

### 3. Function to Get GeoIP Info

The `get_geoip_info` function fetches geographical information for a given IP address using the `ip-api.com` API.

```python
def get_geoip_info(ip):
    try:
        # Using the ipinfo.io API (you could replace this with another API)
        response = requests.get(f'http://ip-api.com/json/{ip}')
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        else:
            print(f"Error fetching GeoIP info for {ip}")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to get GeoIP for {ip}: {e}")
        return None
```

#### Explanation:
- **requests.get(f'http://ip-api.com/json/{ip}')**: This sends a GET request to the `ip-api.com` API to get GeoIP information for the specified IP address.
- **response.status_code == 200**: This checks if the request was successful (HTTP status code 200).
- **response.json()**: This parses the JSON response from the API.
- **Exception Handling**: If an error occurs during the request, it prints an error message and returns `None`.

### 4. Main Script

The `main` function orchestrates the retrieval of banned IPs and the fetching of GeoIP information for each IP.

```python
def main():
    banned_ips = get_banned_ips()
    print(f"Found {len(banned_ips)} banned IP(s) in f2b_permanent.\n")

    for ip in banned_ips:
        geoip_info = get_geoip_info(ip)
        if geoip_info:
            # Display the information (customize as needed)
            print(f"IP: {ip}")
            print(f"Country: {geoip_info.get('country')}")
            print(f"Region: {geoip_info.get('regionName')}")
            print(f"City: {geoip_info.get('city')}")
            print(f"ISP: {geoip_info.get('isp')}")
            print("---------")
```

#### Explanation:
- **get_banned_ips()**: This retrieves the list of banned IPs.
- **len(banned_ips)**: This prints the number of banned IPs.
- **for ip in banned_ips**: This iterates over each banned IP.
- **get_geoip_info(ip)**: This fetches GeoIP information for the current IP.
- **if geoip_info**: This checks if GeoIP information was successfully retrieved.
- **Printing Information**: This prints the IP address and its corresponding GeoIP information.

### 5. Running the Script

The script is designed to be run as a standalone program. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the `main` function is called only when the script is executed directly.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Summary

This program:
1. Retrieves a list of IP addresses that are banned by `fail2ban` from the `f2b_permanent` IP set.
2. Fetches geographical information (GeoIP) for each of those IP addresses using the `ip-api.com` API.
3. Prints the IP address along with its GeoIP information, including country, region, city, and ISP.

This can be useful for understanding the geographical distribution of IP addresses that have been banned by `fail2ban`, which can help in identifying patterns or potential threats.
