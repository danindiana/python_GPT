Yes, the FAISS index in the script is loaded into memory during runtime. Here's how the script functions in detail:

---

### **Key Steps in the Query Script**

#### **1. Loading the FAISS Index**
- **File:** `embeddings.index` (saved in your generation script).
- **Action:** The FAISS index is read from disk into memory using `faiss.read_index(faiss_index_path)`.
- **Why in Memory?**
  - FAISS is optimized for fast similarity searches by keeping data in memory, which is significantly faster than querying a file on disk.

#### **2. Loading the Metadata (`text_mapping.json`)**
- **File:** `text_mapping.json` (maps embeddings to filenames and original texts).
- **Action:** This JSON file is loaded into a Python dictionary using `json.load()`.

#### **3. Generating Query Embeddings**
- A new embedding is generated for the user-provided query string using the same model and tokenizer from the generation script. 
  - **Steps:**
    1. Tokenize the query with the same settings as in the generation script.
    2. Pass the tokens through the same pre-trained model.
    3. Use mean pooling to get the sentence embedding.
    4. Return the embedding as a NumPy array.

#### **4. Searching the FAISS Index**
- The FAISS index is queried with the new query embedding using `index.search(query_embedding, top_k)`:
  - **Input:**
    - `query_embedding`: A single query vector (1 x `d`), where `d` is the embedding dimension (e.g., 768).
    - `top_k`: Number of results to return.
  - **Output:**
    - `distances`: A list of distances (lower values indicate higher similarity).
    - `indices`: The indices of the most similar embeddings in the FAISS index.
- FAISS performs a highly optimized nearest-neighbor search in memory using vector math.

#### **5. Retrieving and Displaying Results**
- The indices returned from the FAISS search are used to fetch corresponding filenames and snippets from the `text_mapping.json`.
  - Each result is formatted with its filename, distance (a measure of similarity), and the first 200 characters of the corresponding text.

---

### **How the Script Works in Practice**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Load the FAISS index and text metadata into memory.
   - Load the transformer model and tokenizer.

2. **Query Process**:
   - User enters a query (e.g., "Explain neural networks").
   - The query is embedded into a vector (using the same model settings as the generation script).
   - The embedding is compared against the FAISS index to find the `top_k` nearest matches.

3. **Result Retrieval**:
   - For each match, the index is used to look up the metadata (filename and snippet).
   - Results are displayed to the user.

4. **Iteration**:
   - The process repeats until the user types "exit".

---

### **Benefits of This Approach**
- **Fast Search**: 
  - The FAISS index is optimized for high-speed searches using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) techniques.
  - Keeping the index in memory ensures minimal latency.
- **Scalable**:
  - FAISS can handle millions of vectors efficiently. For very large datasets, you can use quantization or disk-based indices (e.g., `faiss.IndexIVF`).
- **Reusable**:
  - The saved FAISS index and metadata can be reused across sessions without re-generating embeddings.

---

### **How It Can Be Extended**
1. **Disk-Based Index**:
   - For very large datasets that exceed memory, FAISS supports disk-based indices. Example:
     ```python
     index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(d, nlist, faiss.METRIC_L2)  # Disk-backed inverted index
     ```

2. **Search Result Enhancements**:
   - Display full text.
   - Open the file directly from the script.

3. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Adjust `top_k` for faster or more detailed results.
   - Optimize FAISS parameters (e.g., quantization or IVF).

4. **Advanced Retrieval**:
   - Combine FAISS results with re-ranking models for better semantic relevance.

Would you like a guide on using disk-based indices or fine-tuning FAISS for even larger datasets?

Given your hardware setup, including a high-performance GPU (RTX 4080 SUPER), substantial disk storage (3.6TB NVMe), and a robust CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D), you can efficiently handle very large datasets for FAISS-based indexing and querying. Here's how you can expand the current setup to manage massive datasets:

---

### **Optimized Setup for Large Datasets**

#### **1. Use FAISS Index with Disk Backing**
For datasets too large to fit in memory, FAISS provides index types like **`IndexIVFFlat`** or **`IndexIVFPQ`** with disk support. These indices partition the data into clusters, enabling efficient searches with a lower memory footprint.

##### Steps to Use Disk-Based Index:
1. **Convert to an IVF Index**:
   - An `IndexIVFFlat` or `IndexIVFPQ` index partitions embeddings into clusters (inverted file index).
   - Clustering reduces memory usage while maintaining search speed.

2. **Enable Disk Storage for Large Clusters**:
   - Store cluster data on disk instead of keeping it all in memory.
   - Use FAISSâ€™s `OnDiskInvertedLists`.

##### Example Code:
```python
import faiss
import numpy as np
import os

# Load embeddings from disk (if available)
embeddings = np.load('/path/to/embeddings.npy')  # Load precomputed embeddings
d = embeddings.shape[1]  # Dimensionality

# Set the number of clusters (should be sqrt of dataset size or tuned empirically)
nlist = 4096  # Number of clusters
quantizer = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)  # Use L2 distance for quantizer
index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(quantizer, d, nlist, faiss.METRIC_L2)

# Train the index on a subset of embeddings (required for IVF indices)
index.train(embeddings)

# Save inverted lists to disk (disk-based storage)
invlists = faiss.OnDiskInvertedLists(nlist, d, "/mnt/nvme1n1/inverted_lists")
index.replace_invlists(invlists)

# Add all embeddings to the index
index.add(embeddings)

# Save the trained index for future use
faiss.write_index(index, "/mnt/nvme1n1/large_index.ivf")

print("Index with disk backing created and saved.")
```

---

#### **2. Split Dataset for Incremental Indexing**
If your dataset is too large to process at once:
- Process embeddings in chunks.
- Add each chunk to the FAISS index incrementally.

##### Example:
```python
chunk_size = 10000  # Adjust based on memory constraints
for i in range(0, len(embeddings), chunk_size):
    chunk = embeddings[i:i + chunk_size]
    index.add(chunk)  # Incrementally add to the index
    print(f"Added chunk {i // chunk_size + 1} to the index.")
```

---

#### **3. Optimize GPU Utilization**
FAISS supports GPU-accelerated indexing and searching. Since you have a powerful RTX 4080, leverage it for faster operations.

##### Example:
```python
# Use FAISS's GPU resources
res = faiss.StandardGpuResources()
gpu_index = faiss.index_cpu_to_gpu(res, 0, index)  # Use GPU 0
```

- **For indexing**: Use GPU for training and adding vectors.
- **For searching**: Perform searches on the GPU, especially for dense or complex queries.

---

#### **4. Parallel Processing**
- Utilize multiple CPU cores to preprocess embeddings in parallel.
- Leverage multiple GPUs (your RTX 4080 and Quadro P4000) for training and searching by creating distributed FAISS indices.

---

#### **5. Query Optimization**
For large datasets:
- Set a higher number of `nprobe` clusters to search more thoroughly but at the cost of speed.
- Use hybrid approaches like re-ranking top results with a re-ranker model.

##### Example:
```python
index.nprobe = 10  # Number of clusters to probe during search
distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, k=10)  # Top 10 results
```

---

### **Hardware Utilization Strategy**

- **Disk (NVMe1n1):**
  - Store FAISS inverted lists and large embeddings on the NVMe drive for fast I/O.
  - Use a structured directory to separate indices, metadata, and raw embeddings.

- **GPU (RTX 4080):**
  - Use for compute-intensive operations like query embedding generation and nearest neighbor search.

- **CPU (Ryzen 9 7950X3D):**
  - Preprocess text, handle file I/O, and coordinate batch processing.

---

### **Monitoring and Scaling**
- Use **`nvidia-smi`** and tools like **`htop`** to monitor GPU and CPU usage.
- Use job queues (e.g., `SLURM` or similar) for distributed processing.
